The firm operated between 1901 and 1911 printing postcards and other ephemera.","description":"This postcard is meant to illustrate the stereotype of the modern servant, specifically the Irish maidservant. At the top left of this image, “Our Servants'' is printed. Below this text is a sleeping woman laying on a bed. She remains undisturbed by the bell that rings emphatically above her head with lines radiating out from it that say “R-R-R-R-RING”. The woman remains asleep with a book in her hand, likely showing her preference for leisure activities over her domestic duties, and clothes strewn about the floor to emphasize her laziness. Another woman to the right, presumably her employer based on her access to the bedroom, her dress, and her exasperated expression, peers through the doorway to find her servant fast asleep. Below the bed the text reads, “Waking up Eliza Ann.” The name Eliza Ann was likely meant to emphasize the maid servant’s Irish heritage, as those were both popular Irish names in the early 20th century.  Irish maid servants were often criticized at this time for not being hard-working enough to satisfy their employers. Her lackluster attitude and Irish name are enough to identify her as the Irish “Bridget” stereotype. \n\nAnalysis: The “Irish Bridget” was a stereotype used to describe female domestic servants who immigrated to the US from Ireland between the 1840s and 1930s. This caricatured figure got its name from an important Irish catholic figure, Saint Brigid, which was also a popular name for girls in the mid-19th century. Irish maid servants were privately hired by the heads of households in urban American settings, with whom they typically lived throughout their time of employment as domestic workers. It was extremely common for middle-class white Americans in the urban east to hire an Irish servant as a means of displaying their social status and to assert the family’s position within the refinement of a growing middle class. The idea of “refinement” was defined, in part, by positioning oneself in moral opposition to another group. Irish maidservants served as a scapegoat for this moral opposition, and thus the “Bridget” caricature was developed. One major way that a family’s respectability was assessed was based on their adherence to (Protestant) Christian morality. Irish immigrants, being primarily Catholic, were therefore automatically othered. In order to cast-out Irish immigrants, “Bridget” could be portrayed as unintelligent, lazy, ignorant, pretentious, defiant, demanding, and unaware of the parameters of their social status. In the image depicted above, the Irish servant is characterized as the unintelligent and ignorant “Bridget”. \n\nIt is unclear to whom and to what address this postcard was mailed, due to the quality of the handwriting. However, the message reads, “Hope this will not be youre (sic) case/ With love from youre (sic) friend/ I M D” This message indicates that the recipient is likely the employer of a domestic servant, and perhaps that they are familiar with the “Bridget” stereotype.","analysis":"The “Irish Bridget” was a stereotype used to describe female domestic servants who immigrated to the US from Ireland between the 1840s and 1930s.

The intention behind this imagery was to show a constructed illusion of criadas as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of white influence. The criada’s passivity is emphasized in her inability to look directly at the viewer. There is also an intention to desexualize this figure: the criada is depicted as intentionally plain-looking, so as to negate any suspicions of impropriety and erase the long history of sexual exploitation within domestic service.\nMessage: In Spanish.","analysis":"The goal of this image is to exoticize the criada.

He is also wearing a maroon/brown turban and green/gray flats with socks underneath. He is standing with a long shaft in his right hand. He is looking straight forward, directly at the photographer. The man is standing outside a building, presumably a house, in front of a wooden door that has two glass windows and a rolled up net that would cover the door frame.

This postcard was “Printed in Germany” and is part of a series of postcards by Moorli Dhur & Sons depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian night guard. We do not know if the man photographed actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe image on the postcard would have been a black and white photograph that was later hand painted into color, known as a hand-tinted photograph.

Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men.

She is feeding the baby milk from a goat who stands atop a chair rather than breastfeeding, as the responsibilities of a wet nurse entails. Her position as a domestic is hinted by her simple polka-dotted blue dress and rolled-up sleeves, as though she is accustomed to manual labor or at least belongs to a lower class rather than one denoting luxury. Another child, perhaps about the age of a toddler, rests a hand on her lap while his other hand is placed near his mouth as he looks away absent-mindedly beyond the scope of the photograph, by and large ignored by the wet nurse as she looks down at the baby. The figures and animal appear to be in a barn outside of the home of the domestic’s employers.\n\nAnalysis: This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these, even if made somewhat humorous in the postcard present, raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be used as a “beef tea” of sorts and could explain why cream is present on the table as well. One potentially humorous reading of these items is that the “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, as a popular stereotype about “Bridgets” at the time was that they often stole their employers’ food as their own and would even invite unwelcome guests into the house they served to indulge in the supplies.\n\nMessage: The postcard’s verso contains no personal message or address and is not postmarked. This indicates that the postcard was either hand-delivered to a recipient or saved by the purchaser for a private collection.","analysis":"This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act.

The ayah wears a deep purple blouse under her red and yellow checkered sari. The sari is loosely draped over her shoulder and is raised enough to see her shoeless feet. Instead, her feet have on toe rings. She wears gold jewelry with her hair tied back in a practical bun. In her hand, she carries a colored hand fan. Her other hand is clutching onto a distracted young girl as the ayah looks away from the girl. The child wears comparatively simple attire: a blue frock with a frilled hat and white shoes. Her unoccupied hand reaches for a snarling cat. The background is a rudimentary sketch of a tree and perhaps a house of some kind.\nAnalysis: Ayahs from the British province of Madras were held in much greater esteem than nursemaids from other regions of India: it was widely believed these ayahs were more acclimated to British customs and were, therefore, better at their jobs. Despite their connection to British ways of life, this ayah is highly exoticized in her depiction and it is apparent in the contrast between the ayah’s and ward’s outfits.

The “Madrassee Ayah” might be the best at childcare, but at the end of the day, she is still a native woman.

The words “Servant’s Insurance Act” can be seen at the top right of the postcard as well, underscored as though suggesting its significance to the illustration. Her status as a maid is indicated by her black dress with white trim and a white half-apron, with a ruffled headpiece atop her curly orange hair. She elevates one of her feet, which is crudely bandaged. The dialogue below explains her situation as it reads, “I burnt my small toe and I don’t mean to work till it is quite better, I prefer to have a burnt toe.” To the left is a bedside table with a tray of dishes labeled: “Bovril”, “Cream”, and “Wine”. \n\nAnalysis:   The illustrator of this postcard suggests that female domestic servants were pleased with the benefits offered by Servant’s Insurance Act, and that they used these novel legal protections to shirk their working responsibilities. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers who made less than £160 per year were entitled to mandatory paid medical leave for up to 26 weeks. Sometimes they were also eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Predictably, this requirement was a source of outrage for employers who were responsible for the payments. One can also infer that the postcard’s illustrator intended to criticize Irish immigrant domestic workers, which were pejoratively referred to as “Bridgets”.

The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty shelf-stable meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be mixed with milk to make “beef tea”. From the time of its invention in the 1870’s, Bovril was marketed as nutritious and protein-rich food that could restore one’s health and strength. One reading of these items, which the contemporary viewer would have found humorous, is that “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, with the secret intention to indulge in the supplies. \n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Dear A., first a card to say they did not do anything to Fred eyes just gave him some eye lotion and (?) oil and he [h]as to go up again will let you know more on Monday when I have (?) day.

The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty shelf-stable meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be mixed with milk to make “beef tea”. From the time of its invention in the 1870’s, Bovril was marketed as nutritious and protein-rich food that could restore one’s health and strength. One reading of these items, which the contemporary viewer would have found humorous, is that “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, with the secret intention to indulge in the supplies. \n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Dear A., first a card to say they did not do anything to Fred eyes just gave him some eye lotion and (?) oil and he [h]as to go up again will let you know more on Monday when I have (?) day.

The woman’s skin is almost entirely black, with any and all breaks in the totality of the blackness serving the purpose of shading. The woman is dressed as a domestic servant: a blue bonnet, a black button up maid blouse, a blue skirt, pink slippers, and a white apron. The woman’s facial features accentuate her lips as especially thick and bright red. The postcard is captioned as if the woman is saying, “I jess can’t make ma eyes behave” - presumably referring to her reading a book.\n\nAnalysis: The woman’s thick, red lips are common in racialized caricatures of Black people. Also common in these racialized depictions is the sheerness of Black skin, which serves to distinguish the individual as one in a binary of skin color. This binary, in turn, suggests a binary in civility, cleanliness, and rationality. In both of these binaries, this Black woman is suggested as being in the lesser of the two categories. The woman is depicted as working as a domestic servant, and reading on the job. The caption, “I jess can’t make ma eyes behave,” could have a number of interpretations. Perhaps the caption means to insinuate that reading while on the job is the supposed misbehavior; or perhaps the transgression is the fact that a Black woman is reading at all. Regardless of the caption’s specific intention, the postcard’s guiding narrative is that Black women exercising their autonomy is looked down upon (and perhaps works against the interests of her employer, depending on one’s interpretation). The fact that the Black woman is depicted as a domestic servant points to her being in a relatively-lesser position on the socioeconomic ladder; and it is assumed that the woman is in the service of a middle-class white family. \n\nMessage: This postcard was sent from Cheyenne School in Colorado Springs, Colorado to Kellyville Oklahoma.

What is interesting, however, is that this racialized postcard was being purchased and sent so nonchalantly that the sender can comfortably make no mention of the illustration; this speaks to the vast diffusion and acceptance of the racial narratives and conceptions expressed in this postcard.","analysis":"The woman’s thick, red lips are common in racialized caricatures of Black people.

A woman to the right presents a bowl of potatoes to the dinner table, directing her gaze at the male diner who appears to be laughing. His hands are thrown up in the air, his index finger raised as if about to point at the woman who is scantily dressed by early 20th century standards. The woman in the white underdress looks back at the man plainly, while the modestly dressed woman to the left throws her hands up in shock. The text at the bottom of this postcard reads, “How Bridget served the potatoes ,,undressed’’ ” The subtext below this reads, “I’ll not take off another stitch if I lose my place.” \n\nAnalysis: To serve the potatoes “undressed” would typically be understood as an instruction to leave the condiments on the side of the dish. However, this text highlights the Irish servant’s misinterpretation of her employer's instructions, which she took quite literally, serving the salad in her underwear. Compared with the dress of the other two women, the maidservant is practically in her underwear which causes her embarrassment, the guests’ shock, and the other woman’s anger. The diners and the server inhabit a moderately furnished home, signifying their middle class status. The contemporary viewer would have immediately understood the character on the far right to be an Irish maidservant, or a Bridget, based on her act of domestic servitude and her ignorance towards common English phrases. \n\nThis postcard was sent to a Miss.

He is also wearing a pale yellow turban and traditional Indian shoes. He is leaning against or pushing against a wooden door with his right hand while holding a broom and a woven basket in his left arm. He looks away without engaging the viewer. The surrounding area includes a white cement building, which may be a home, and a dusty, dirt path. \nThe postcard contains the caption “MEHTAR (SWEEPER).” The image is vertical making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. This postcard was “Printed in Germany” and is part of a series of postcards by Moorli Dhur & Sons depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian sweeper called Mehtar. We do not know if the man photographed actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe image on the postcard would have been a black and white photograph that was later hand painted into color, known as a hand-tinted photograph. As a hand-tinted work, the artist had discretion over the colors used, and his bright white, blemish-free clothes may have been how he dressed, however, it is arguable that his dress, particularly its coloring, was emphasized as a way to exoticisize him; how could he be laboring all day as a sweeper and be dressed so neatly? \nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men.

Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of an Indian manservant would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nAccording to European gender roles, the Indian servant is performing feminine tasks, and by ethnographically representing Indian men in this manner, the British audience is inclined to assume he, and thus all Indian men, are effeminate.  \nMehtars, or sweepers, were recruited from dalit, the “untouchable” caste in Indian society, and their labor was stigmatized. \nThis postcard is part of a set of postcards illustrating different types of men-servants in British imperial India.

The words “Servant’s Insurance Act” can be seen at the top right of the postcard as well, underscored as though suggesting its significance to the illustration. Her status as a maid is indicated by her black dress with white trim and a white half-apron, with a ruffled headpiece atop her curly orange hair. She elevates one of her feet, which is crudely bandaged. On the small bedside table that features in the postcard, there are three items atop a tray with the following labels, from left to right: “Bovril,” “Cream,” and “Wine.” At the bottom of the postcard, the text seems to clarify the maid’s situation, and reads: “I burnt my small toe and I don’t mean to work till it is quite better, I prefer to have a burnt toe.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these, even if made somewhat humorous in the postcard present, raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be used as a “beef tea” of sorts and could explain why cream is present on the table as well. One potentially humorous reading of these items is that the “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, as a popular stereotype about “Bridgets” at the time was that they often stole their employers’ food as their own and would even invite unwelcome guests into the house they served to indulge in the supplies.\n\nMessage: This verso contains no personal message, being solely reserved for the address.

As a hand-tinted work, the artist had discretion over the colors used, and his bright, blemish-free clothes may have been how he dressed, however, it is arguable that his dress, particularly its coloring, was emphasized as a way to exoticisize him; how could he be laboring all day and be dressed so neatly and brightly? \nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of an Indian manservant would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nAccording to European gender roles, the Indian servant is performing feminine tasks, and by ethnographically representing Indian men in this manner, the British audience is inclined to assume he, and thus all Indian men, are effeminate.\nThis postcard is part of a set of postcards illustrating different types of men-servants in British imperial India. It is labeled “1355” on the verso.\nMessage: n/a","message":"n/a","__v":0,"imageLinks":[{"_id":"67081b3867fa9da418a003fa","name":"208B","link":"/images/postcards/208B.jpg","size":{"width":1109,"height":1734},"orientation":1,"cardNumber":208},{"_id":"67081b3967fa9da418a003fb","name":"208A","link":"/images/postcards/208A.jpg","size":{"width":1103,"height":1727},"orientation":1,"cardNumber":208}],"originalLocation":{"latitude":51.1638175,"longitude":10.4478313,"_id":"67ccb20c6c89aaaae23d411a"},"isBlurByDefault":false,"isInScrapbook":false,"themes":["Anthropological/ethnographic","South Asia","Orientalism","Photographic","Emasculation","Moorli Dhur & Sons","Hand Tinted","British Empire","Men-servants","New Imperialism"]},{"_id":"670580731d3345f198753b43","number":310,"item":"postcard","date":"November 6, 1907","postmarked":"Yes","place":null,"company":"Davidson Bros’ Pictorial Postcards","companyInformation":"Davidson Brothers was located in both London and New York City.

In the illustration, the central female figure can be identified as a domestic servant by her simple black dress, white apron, and bonnet. She faces an older woman with a look of concern, propping herself up against a door which conceals an army man whom she presumably invited inside. The dialogue above the older woman, whose expression looks angry, says, “There’s a strong smell of tobacco, Jane.” \n\nAnalysis: This illustration hints at the sexual impropriety that was thought to characterize white female domestics at the time. Irish female servants were particularly associated with this criticism, and the servant here can be identified as such due to her bright red hair and being called Jane, which is a common Irish name. The illustration also implies that the servant is neglecting her housework by entering into a sexual liason with the military officer, characterizing her as lazy and promiscuous. In addition, doors are a commonly used in portrayals of Irish servants’ sexual impropriety, as they signify the demarcation of private space. Within the context of one’s home, doors symbolize the precarious position that domestic servants held as being not quite family, but also not quite outside the family, making any sexual encounter they had with another member of the household scandalous. Although the man in this scene is most likely not a member of the household, the door is still used as a symbol of secrecy to conceal their intentions. \n\nThis postcard was sent to a Mr or Miss (honorific is somewhat illegible) A.

She is feeding a white baby from a bottle while sitting on a red and white chair. The child rests on her lap atop a white pillow, and wrapped in a white cloth. The woman herself is wearing a red, white, and yellow dress - seemingly made up of various clothing pieces; she wears a knotted yellow headdress with red dots. The woman is looking down at the child she is feeding. The most notable detail on her face is her thick, red lips. She is seated in a well furnished room, with white sheer curtains and a cushioned chair. At the woman’s feet is a red bag that reads, “Dinah Jones.” At the top of the postcard is its title, which reads, “An Early Breakfast on a ‘Dinah.’” The verso side of the card is undivided, and includes a stamp; there is no message written, only an address for the intended recipient.\nAnalysis: The image depicts a Black servant woman caring for a child who is, presumably, that of her employer. Her mismatched, shabby clothing contrasts with the clean, comfortable, and fancy room she is seated in. This contrast highlights the gap in socio-economic status between the woman and her employer. The woman is in service to a white child, and her delicate care is indicative of early 20th century notions of a Mammy. Her headdress, accentuated lips, and clothing all serve to racialize her as a brutish, unclean, uncivil person. Her handbag suggests that it is her profession to care for children (among other potential, though unclarified, jobs she may perform for her employer). The woman is named “Dinah Jones,” spelled in such a way as to denote her perceived lack of language skills. The title suggests that the work she is performing is being done very early in the morning, long before her employer would usually be awake and working; and the woman’s contented facial expression asserts her comfort and happiness with this reality. This contentment perpetuates the narrative of the white civilizing burden, and of benevolent patriarchalism. \nMessage: The postcard is addressed to a “Miss Mary Pl… [?]” in Little Rock Arkansas.

This Chinese amah is depicted wearing a collared white shirt with loose three-quarter length sleeves. Her skin, for the most part, is covered. She is wearing dark pants that fall just above her ankles. Her hair is pulled back in a way that was practical for domestic servants and she has a placid expression while she looks towards the camera. She stands outside, on a grassy area next to what appears to be a home. The home has shuttered windows and tall columns on the outside. In the background, a male servant stands, partially obscured by the Chinese amah, but still looking at the camera. \nAnalysis:  This postcard clearly presents this Chinese amah, or nursemaid, in a service role. The amah’s modest outfit serves to highlight her respectability and negate any suspicions of impropriety as Britain grew increasingly anxious about interracial communication and relationships. The fears of miscegenation were projected onto female domestic workers’ bodies, especially as nursemaids as they were seen as alternate mothers, as it became uniquely important to hide any illicitness that may have existed in these associations. Intended for a British audience, this postcard serves to dispel anxieties about impropriety but this is not to say that such sexual harrassment did not occur: domestic and sexual labor often went hand in hand in these close, oppressive relationships. In presenting this desexualized figure, the postcard aids in the effort of erasing a history of sexual exploitation. This postcard is also a type image, in that the postcard presents a particular category of native women who then represents a particular white, romanticized construction of race—in this case, the “type” is the Chinese amah. The exclusion of the subject’s name serves to depersonalize and homogenize the amah to further fit the rhetoric of a “type” photograph. She is not herself,  but rather a representation of all Chinese amahs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis: Chinese people were imported to live with British families in Singapore, since the local people were not considered fit to be servants. These Chinese female servants worked in tandem with the “houseboys.” Both Chinese men and women working in domestic service were perceived to be the ideal servants with eagerness to serve others.","analysis":"This postcard clearly presents this Chinese amah, or nursemaid, in a service role.

The woman bears a furrowed brow and a squint, as if she is out in the Sun. She is performing no task; instead she is sitting, looking into the distance beyond the camera. All colors are muted except for her lips, which are a bright red. Besides the brown background, the only other colors in the photograph are the white of her headdress, the Black of her body (including her skin and eyes), and the beige/yellow and brown of her dress. Her attire is modest, bland, and plain. The title of the postcard is, “No. 5, Old Mammie.” The title paired with the portrait gives the postcard a quasi-anthropological feel; there is no humor to be had. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard, unlike a great number of “mammy” postcards, does not feature a cartoon caricature; the subject is instead a photograph. Given the anthropological, supposedly objective presentation of the image, any and all racializations of the photograph’s subject can be marked as intentional. Her lips are artificially red; although its relative brightness may be an artifact of the printing process, the woman’s lips are still very intentionally uniquely colored. The bright red lip is very common in 19th and 20th century depictions of Black women, making this photograph especially complicit in the perpetuation of that stereotype (given the asserted objectivity of this pseudo-anthropological photograph). Her headdress (despite its lack of bright colors) is a hallmark of Mammy iconography, and stands to denote the Black woman’s “exotic” heritage as an “other.” This postcard is one of a series (hence its numbering as “No. 5”) of supposedly anthropological images of America. The publishing company, it can then be presumed, thought the Mammy was such a significant aspect of American mythology and ideation that this image was included. Her furrowed brow, squint, and bare attire signify her role as a laborer - working in the Sun and getting her clothing dirty. The “dirty” and “drab” appearance signify her relatively low position on the socio-economic hierarchy. It is important to note that, although this is a photograph of a living woman, one cannot assume any aspect of this photograph to be accurate or true-to-life. The photographer can stage their subject as they please, the printer can color the postcard (and thus highlight whatever they want) on a whim, and the publishing company can call this woman whatever they want - none of this, however, is necessarily accurate. \n\nMessage: This postcard is being sent from Atlanta, Georgia to San Diego, California.

The sender’s inclusion of the phrase, “or worse,” suggests that the sender and recipient are white, and look down upon the Mammy with pity, disdain, or an otherwise negative view. The sender means to share an experience of social and racial privilege with the recipient, which is indicated by the comment - “or worse” - that is mean to humorously suggest that the figure of the Black Mammy is loathsome.","analysis":"This postcard, unlike a great number of “mammy” postcards, does not feature a cartoon caricature; the subject is instead a photograph.

The image is a black and white photograph. The Indian man wears a pristine white turban, a domestic service uniform, and does not wear shoes. Over his shoulder is slung a goat skin pouch that is filled with water. He navigates the mouth of this pouch in order to water the grass lawn he is standing upon. In the background is green shrubbery. The message is very unusually placed on the front of the postcard, likely due to postcards not offering space to write a message on the back at this point in time.\n Analysis: This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet into the daily life of an Indian male servant, as though the viewer had stumbled on the scene naturally occurring. These glimpses into the everyday life of ethnic servants served convey Western influence in the colonies, especially the nature of interracial relations. Postcards such as this one would have allowed for those back home to witness a glimpse of how the British interacted with the native classes, and how the latter were incorporated into the daily lives of the former through domestic work. In presenting this as the norm, the postcard also accomplishes a solidification of the hierarchy of races: this postcard helps to normalize natives as domestic servants for white people. This postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on the water carrier, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through his depersonalization. In labeling these He is denied his identity and is forced to embody a white construction of the Indian race. The intention behind this colonial imagery was to show a constructed illusion of natives as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of the empire to the British public back home. The water carrier’s passivity is emphasized in his inability to look directly at the viewer.These menservants, who were homogenized in that they were never given names in postcards, were naturals at domestic service—they were thus denied an identity outside of their service. These glimpses into empire allowed foreigners to India to have access to and participate in civilizing efforts in India despite their distance, while actively exoticizing and othering the experiences of Indian men to fit their own understanding of what constituted a native man. \nMessage: The message is half of the original, which was likely sent over the span of multiple postcards. It states: “I had a letter from Nanee today that had been to Bombay & had followed us home again that accounts for my not having many letters last trip. I wonder if there are any more wandering round the globe trying to find me. This Johnnie is watering the roads & the bag arrangement that is slung round his neck is a goat skin. There are no water carts to be seen in Bombay—these fellows do nearly all there is to be done. Now I shall have to stop here for we are off in another …” In the sender’s goal of depicting the nature of Indian life, they depict Indian men servants as committed workers, but ultimately ineffectual in comparison to British technologies.","analysis":"This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet into the daily life of an Indian male servant, as though the viewer had stumbled on the scene naturally occurring.

The firm operated between 1901 and 1911 printing postcards and other ephemera. The illustrator, Ludovici, was a genre painter and landscape painter. Whilst Whistler was President of the Royal Society of British Artists","description":"In this postcard, the lady of the house shown appears to be pressing her hands against a door in an attempt to stop a monocled old man from peering into the room. It is possible that the man is simply a guest, but it is also possible given his top hat in hand and his  other formal attire that he is the lady’s husband. On the right-hand side of the postcard, farther into the room, another white woman dressed in an elaborate yellow gown, red lipstick, and an impressive hairdo sits beside a table with a comb and flowers. She looks coyly behind her at the other woman and man, as though aware that she is the object of the ruckus because the man is vying for a glimpse of her youthful beauty captured by this illustrator. At the top of the postcard, centered, reads the simple title “The Lady’s Maid.” A personal message is also apparently written on the front near the bottom of the illustration, which reads, “I know you like being a lady’s maid.” When paired with the text, it seems that the extravagantly-clad woman is actually a white maidservant who works for the male employer ogling her from afar, a surprising revelation that certainly warrants further analysis. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these, even if made somewhat humorous in the postcard present, raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be used as a “beef tea” of sorts and could explain why cream is present on the table as well. One potentially humorous reading of these items is that the “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, as a popular stereotype about “Bridgets” at the time was that they often stole their employers’ food as their own and would even invite unwelcome guests into the house they served to indulge in the supplies.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Dearest Maud, I received the postcard that you send and I think it simply lovely[.] give my love to harry & tommie & choud[.] hoping you will all think it is like Muriel and I do hope she is a good girl.

The image is in black and white. Both ayahs in question wear the traditional domestic service white sari with a dark border with their veils over their hair in a display of modesty and age. The younger ayah on the right wears shoes, whereas the older ayah on the left does not. The ayah on the right pushes the baby carriage and her body hides an older white girl. She peeks at the photographer through the carriage and wears a white frock with black shoes and socks. The baby in the carriage wears a white frilly dress with a matching hat. The older ayah holds the older child’s sun hat in her hands. Around them, many people are engaged in activities, like walking or talking. The palm trees stand out, as well as the large building in the background. \nAnalysis: This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet into the daily life of an ayah and her white ward, as though the viewer had stumbled on the scene naturally occurring. These glimpses into the everyday life of ethnic servants served convey Western influence in the colonies, especially the nature of interracial relations. The relationship between ayah and her white ward is one of the most intimate of interracial living, and postcards such as this one would have allowed for those back home to witness a glimpse of how comfortable each party was with one another. In presenting this as the norm, the postcard also accomplishes a solidification of the hierarchy of races: this postcard helps to normalize natives as domestic servants for white people. Ayahs, who were homogenized in that they were never given names in postcards, were the natural caretakers of white children—they are thus denied an identity outside of their service.

The Muslim patriarch sits atop a rug, and presumably a cushion as well, in the backdrop of the illustration. Lounging on his right from the viewer’s perspective is likely his wife or primary concubine, who rests her head on one of her hands as she looks ahead to witness the performance provided by snake charmers before them. These women are completely nude, with only their genitalia left unexposed by a thin strand of cloth that dangles in strings down their legs. A relatively white-skinned female servant holds an arm to the sky with a snake dangling from it, while another on the left-hand side of the postcard shows only a side profile to the viewer as she rests atop a cushion on the floor and looks up at the snake charmer. A darker-skinned female servant sits on the right-hand side of the postcard with a drum in her lap. \n\nAnalysis: \nWhen this image is paired with the text on the back of the postcard, it becomes apparent that the photograph is meant to create an association between the woman pictured and earlier servants found inside “Oriental” harems, the separate spaces of older Muslim households designated for wives, concubines, and female domestics. At once, the space in which the viewer finds himself or herself is both anachronistic and intimate, as this domestic space was often conceptualized in European imagination as the inviolable domain of a woman in which only close relations and friends were permitted entry. Harems were also perceived as spaces of depravity, languor, and sexual promiscuity. This is perhaps encapsulated best through the almost entirely nude “Oriental female servants present, who appear to perform for the pleasure of the man featured.  As such, the sight of a non-white woman in such an imagined space likely offered European consumers respite from the rigid standards of sexual propriety that governed their own lives in their metripoles. This is hinted further by the personal message on the verso, since the writer notes the peculiarity/rareness of such a sight in France where it is considered indecent for especially white women to put their bodies on display. The women photographed are deprived of their personhood, merely labeled a snake charmers who exist for the imagined pleasure and service of the Muslim patriarch and now, the photographers seem to suggest, offer up their bodies in a similar, guilt-absolving way to the viewer. When colonized bodies were so frequently exploited for labor and their employment as domestics often flaunted the wealth and social status of European families, possessing a non-white woman’s body through postcard consumption enabled people who had never stepped foot within a colony to directly participate in and support the imperial enterprise of their homeland. Here, almost entirely nude, the unnamed “Oriental” women can be violated for the voyeuristic gratification of the viewer. These personal imperial victories were likely magnified because of the usual difficulty of seeing Egyptian women in such a way, given that the majority of them were Muslim and often kept much of their faces and bodies veiled under turbans and loose, flowing attire. Thus, contemporaries may have found the image especially intriguing for how it revealed what was otherwise forbidden, shrouded in mystery within a period when Europeans strove through ethnographic and anthropological studies to know all about their colonized peoples. Finally, the practice of snake charming could be a desire to exotify the “Orient” and its peoples, painting them as more superstitious and fanciful—as can also be deduced from the ornate architecture—rather than rational and practical. \n\nMessage: This postcard contains the following personal message on its verso, translated from French: My dear, you will perhaps find this card a bit indecent, but here it is not uncommon to see naked women and even more (?) than that; the other evening, I went to see the Egyptian (?)  ; I assure you that it was interesting, they were dancing all naked; if we were to see that in France, we would be undignified, but here it is all natural.

The woman stands in the center of the image alongside a white, carved table. Behind her are curtains. With her arm placed on the table, the woman stares into the camera and is wearing a striped, wrapped skirt with a frilly, white blouse on top. She is wearing minimal jewelry, but her necklace appears to have a cross pendant, signaling Christian faith. She does not wear shoes. The text at the bottom simply states, “Sinhelese Ayah.”\nAnalysis: The image depicts what is described as a Sinhalese Ayah: Sinhalese referring to the language and ethnic group located in the British colony of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) and ayahs being the native nursemaids particular to the South Asian region. The ayah’s outfit represents a blending of cultures that would have been central in British households: her skirt is of native origin (perhaps a variation of the sari), but her blouse is atypical of traditional native attire and likely of British introduction. The postcard is a “type”, which was a category of colonial imagery in which the subject stares directly at the camera in a staged setting. They showcased an individual who represented a particular white, romanticized construction of race—in this case, the “type” is the Sinhalese ayah. The intention was to show a constructed illusion of natives as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of the empire to the British public back home. The cross necklace worn by the ayah ia meant to display the modernizing and civilizing influence that the British presence had on the natives. Even the use of “ayah” in the text, rather than the subject’s name, serves to depersonalize and homogenize the ayah to further fit the rhetoric of a “type” photograph. She is not herself,  but rather a representation of all Sinhalese ayahs. \nMessage: The message on the verso reads: “No letter in the mail yesterday! Is there an ink shortage in England? The picture is of a very respectable nursemaid and a type that is not common here. We are still in the throes of monsoon and rain is more than plentiful but it's [unreadable].” The message is addressed to a woman in London, England, from the writer’s stay in Ceylon. Thus, the postcard was likely used to depict the British mission in the colonies in a positive light for readers back home. In using “very respectable nursemaid” to refer to this ayah, the writer is likely referring to her Anglicanized way of dress and her (at least visibly) Christian faith. In doing so, she displays the moralizing mission, but also dispels any suggestions of impropriety within empire.","analysis":"The image depicts what is described as a Sinhalese Ayah: Sinhalese referring to the language and ethnic group located in the British colony of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) and ayahs being the native nursemaids particular to the South Asian region.

The girl clutches a smaller light-skinned, blonde-haired boy close to her, holding him by the wrists. Each of the figures is highly stylized; the rounded features, large heads, low-set eyes, and wide cheeks give each of them a childlike quality. The two taller figures stand at eye-level with each other, and they exchange a cheeky stare from the corners of their eyes. The dark-skinned boy was drawn with racialized features, including the widened nose bridge, large red lips, and full cheeks. The smaller light-skinned boy looks up with raised eyebrows and an open mouth, his gaze directed towards the dark-skinned boy. The text below is written in Spanish, and it reads, “Oye, chacha: ¿ese soldado de chocolate es malo? / No… ¡es regular!” This translates, in English, to “Hey maid: is this chocolate soldier bad? / No… he is okay!” \n\nAnalysis: The juxtaposition between the light-skinned girl and the dark-skinned boy is apparent upon first glance at the postcard. The contrast between the two characters is emphasized by their skin tones, but also by their gendered attributes, costumes, and a vertical compositional divide that splits the image down the center. This postcard is not dated, but it can be inferred that this postcard was designed in the early 20th century due to the apparent relationship between the two identified characters. The postcard’s text mentions the word chacha, or maid; the viewer would be able to associate that role with the girl on the right based on the traditional maid’s uniform of a black dress and white apron. In early 20th century Great Britain and the United States, female domestic servants were very common members of a typical middle class household, and they often did the work of child-rearing. Since this postcard was produced in Barcelona and circulated in wider Spain, it is likely that women there could also work in the domestic sphere. At the very least, it shows that Spain was aware of this societal role. The racialized characterization of Black males was also rampant during the early 20th century. The “Sambo” caricature was depicted as an innocent child who was content blindly to follow orders. Although “Sambo” might take on seemingly adult roles, he would never be viewed as a fully competent grown man. The cartoon drawing of a Black male on this postcard fits right into the “Sambo” stereotype, as he is childlike but dressed like a soldier. In addition to being drawn with racist characteristics, he is called the “chocolate soldier” who is assumed to be an enemy until proven otherwise. However, the maid assures the questioning little boy that the dark-skinned soldier is not a threat, which plays into the “innocent Sambo” caricature. \n\nMessage: This postcard was sent to one Angeles Franqueza. It was mailed to “Casa Franqueza” in Aguafría, Spain, which appears to be a small town located about 100 km northwest of Seville. Since this postcard is from Barcelona, the message may be written either in Spanish or Catalan, both of which are regional languages. From the legible Spanish words in the message, the sender seems to be recounting a recent trip. The sender expresses their eagerness to hear back from the recipient, when they will tell more about the trip and exchange great hugs. Throughout the message there is also mention of one’s parents and sisters, most likely those related to the recipient. The message is addressed to a female friend (amiga), and closed the same way, signifying that this is a correspondence between two women. A third person, Giana, is also mentioned several times throughout the message. However, the message has no apparent relationship with the image on the front of this postcard. \n\nTags: \nMammy stereotype\nOrientalized stereotype \nHarem stereotype\nMen-servants\nIrish Bridget stereotype\nSouth Asia\nIndian ayah\nChinese amah\nRacist Caricature\nAnthropological/ethnographic\nEmasculation\nDesexualization  \nSexualization\nInfantilization\nAnimalization \nNew Imperialism\nAsian Exclusion\nJim Crow\nAntebellum nostalgia\nSentimentalization\nSexual impropriety\nLazy/stupid stereotype\nBritish Empire\nFrance\nGermany\nFrench Empire\nUSA\nUK\nServants Insurance\nPhotographic\nHand-tinted\nWhite-bordered\nLinen postcards\nTom Browne illustration\nBamforth Moorli Dhur & Sons\nTuck’s\nAnti-semitic\nStamp licking\nWashing\nChocolate\nCoffee\nTea\nClothing/thread\nFood\nScrapbooking\n\nGeneral Rule for Dating Unknown Cards:\nTrade Cards: assume it is ~1880s / late 1880s\nPost Cards: early 1900s","analysis":"The juxtaposition between the light-skinned girl and the dark-skinned boy is apparent upon first glance at the postcard.

Below this text is a door which is bent into a curve to emphasize the relentless knocking on it, accompanied by calls from her employers that are unmet such as: “Bridget, plea-se get up”, “darling Bridget,” and “Breakfast is ready.”  The diagonal lines radiating from these exclamations draws the viewer's eye to the sleeping woman laying on a bed to the left. She remains undisturbed by the yelling, pounding on the door, and the alarm clock that rings emphatically above her head. On the floor near one of her hands that dangles from the bed, there lies a book titled Left at the Halter by Ella-Wheeler Woolsocks. Finally, a wine glass appears to be resting precariously atop a mantle jutting out from the wall behind the domestic’s bed.\n\nAnalysis: \nThis depiction of an Irish domestics clearly aligns itself with the day’s stereotypes of such immigrant workers as very lazy characters, those who shirked their responsibilities at the expense of their employers. Despite the clock signifying that the time is 9 o’ clock, by most accounts a reasonable hour for a servant to wake up, Bridget is still fast asleep living in a relatively unhygienic room due to her lack of organization as hinted by clothes strewn about the floor to emphasize her laziness and a small fly also visible above her open mouth. The woman dangles a book from her hand, likely showing her preference for leisure activities over her domestic duties. The calls of her employer indicate benevolence toward this Bridget, and their calling her to breakfast insinuates a role reversal in the servant-employer relationship, which the contemporary viewer would have found both frustrating and humorous at once. Such perceived demeanors of these domestics exacerbated what Americans believed was a shortage of competent servants in the industry around this time, and an increased call to rely upon servants from other demographics to fulfill especially middle- and upper-class demand for domestic labor. Furthermore, the alcohol beverage shown also invokes an offensive stereotype which assumes that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these raised alarm that American and British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. \n\nMessage: “Does it look like me, am ancious [sic] to hear from you. Sister Sophia is home on a visit will leave friday, am having a fine old time. hope to hear from you soon. Anna.” The message is addressed to “Miss Lena Leuser” and then refers to a place that looks like “Corder, Mo.”","analysis":"This depiction of an Irish domestics clearly aligns itself with the day’s stereotypes of such immigrant workers as very lazy characters, those who shirked their responsibilities at the expense of their employers.

Company","companyInformation":null,"description":"This postcard features an illustration of a wealthy white woman and her servant Black woman. The card’s illustration is set in the winter, and so the white woman is wearing a wide-brimmed hat, ornate hat, a mink coat, and a muff. The attire of the Black woman is unclear (save for her knotted headdress), as she is behind the white woman; only her face is visible as she looks over the shoulder of the white woman. While the white woman has her hands warm, the Black woman appears to be holding boxes. The women are walking in a snowy field, with bare trees and snow-topped hills in the background. Both women look happy: the white woman bears a toothy smile, and the Black woman is wearing a contented, though reserved, facial expression. While the white woman is looking toward the observer, the Black woman is looking toward the white woman. The white woman’s muff and the caption of the postcard are adorned with holly leaves. The postcard’s caption reads, “Here’s to Christmas and New Years together Sunshiny hearts whatever the weather.” \n\nAnalysis: This card is very explicit in its distinction between the racial, social, and class differences between the two women. The white woman is dressed in expensive, fancy, and ornate clothing; meanwhile, the only discernible article of clothing of the Black woman (her headdress) appears relatively drab, and is indicative of her race and labor. Black women are often caricatured as wearing a knotted headdress, which is meant to be a nod to her heritage as an “exotic,” “otherized,” individual. Their class differences are also apparent in the fact that the white woman’s hands are free, while the hands of the Black woman are busy carrying boxes. Their differences in social standing are made most obvious, however, in their position relative to one another. The white woman is standing front and center, almost entirely blocking off the Black woman from view; the head of the white woman is held higher than the head of the Black woman is; the eyes of the Black woman are also fixed on the white woman, which is symbolic of the fact that her importance is tied to the social standing of the white woman she serves. \n\nMessage: It is unclear where this postcard was sent from (due to wear on the postcard) but the postcard was sent to Downs, Kansas. The message on the card is long, and reads: “Dear Sister, How are you and how is school? We are about as usual. We will each have one week’s vacation. Would like to see you all. We are very busy. More to do than we can get done. Write to us we are always glad to hear from you. As ever, Orlin.” Although the message itself is not explicitly related to the subject matter of the postcard, it can be discerned that this postcard was interpreted by the sender as being well-meaning, sincere, and loving; the sender thought this postcard was appropriate to send to his sister.","analysis":"This card is very explicit in its distinction between the racial, social, and class differences between the two women.

He is wearing a white collared shirt, a vest, and a brown jacket, with gray/black pants and shoes. He has white hair, eyebrows, and facial hair. His hands are folded in his lap and he looks away from the camera, not engaging the viewer. The background is blank with beige tones. The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. The verso contains the caption “UNCLE ALFRED – Faithful servant of President Jackson. Buried near the tomb in the garden of THE HERMITAGE Home of General Andrew Jackson Seventh President of the United States Nashville, Tennessee.”\nAnalysis: This postcard shows the stereotype of ‘Tom’ who is a faithful, submissive, and happy enslaved man. The Tom stereotype was introduced in the Antebellum period as a defense to slavery as he represents a reliable, happy Christian server. He is gentle. He tends to be old and reliant on white’s approval. The term “Uncle Tom” is still used as a derogatory reference for a black man seen as excessively subservient to white people, and an appeaser and apologist for white supremacy and racism. In this postcard, “Uncle Alfred,” the name used for President Jackson’s slave, supports the “Uncle Tom” stereotype. \nThe postcard published in the early 1900s shows American lingering nostalgia for slavery and Southern life. Being published nearly 50 years post-emancipation, the postcard creators had discretion over the slave narrative. They illustrate Uncle Alfred as well-dressed and content, therefore sparking the question for proponents of slavery: how could slavery be wrong if black servants, males (Tom caricatures) and females (Mammy carictures) were contented and loyal? The early 1900s audience could hypothesize that slaves were well taken care of because of the postcard depiction of their caricatures. This eradicates white American and European responsibility and guilt over slavery.\nMoreover, this responsibility is eliminated through language. Although “Uncle Alfred,” now called Alfred Jackson, was a generationally enslaved person in the Jackson family, the postcard caption labels him as a “servant” which removes the awareness of his enslavement.  \nMessage: n/a","analysis":"This postcard shows the stereotype of ‘Tom’ who is a faithful, submissive, and happy enslaved man.

The girl is reclining in a white, ornate, cushioned arm chair while a white boy (perhaps her brother) stands next to her. The Black woman’s attire (a modest blue blouse, a mismatched green skirt, white apron, and knotted red headdress) contrasts with the formal, fancy attire of the children she is serving. The girl is wearing a sheer white dress with a bright red robe, and the boy is wearing a light blue suit with a black kerchief. The woman’s face conveys a kind of stoic, almost contented focus in dressing the child; the face of the girl she is dressing, however, is apathetic and bored. The house they are set in appears to be of a wealthy family: colorful walls, and open sheer curtains. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard shows an older Black “Mammy” working as a domestic servant to her white employers’ children. Her modest and mismatched clothing denotes her relatively low socio-economic status (especially as it is juxtaposed with the fancy attire of the white children). The woman’s apron and rolled-up sleeves also symbolize her labor. Her knotted red headdress is meant to represent her heritage as a member of an “exotic,” “otherized” race. Her stoic expression communicates her understanding of the necessity of her labor; the white girl’s apathetic appearance is symbolic of the wider (white) population’s indifference and insensitivity towards Black people. This illustration also plays into the narrative that Black women prefer to care for white children. The Black woman’s contented face illustrates her appreciation for the labor she performs. However, this kind of contentment is not realistic - a domestic worker would not be appreciative of the nature of her labor; her portrayed contentment is a symptom of the benevolent paternalistic narrative that the employment of the “uncivilized” lower classes and races is enriching for them. The title’s general focus (“The Mammy”) signifies this relationship between the Black domestic worker and the wealthy white household as being average. The publishers of this postcard thought that this image was representative of the life and nature of the “Mammy.”","analysis":"This postcard shows an older Black “Mammy” working as a domestic servant to her white employers’ children.

They specialize in photo postcards that depict romanticized images of scenery and women.","description":"This postcard’s illustration is a photo-realistic painting of a young Black woman holding a white child in her lap. The woman is holding the infant carefully and lovingly, which matches the contented look on her face. The child is naked, and is resting on a white towel. The woman is dressed in what seems to be a traditional attire: a knotted, dotted headdress and a light-colored shawl with stripes and circles on it. She is also wearing earrings, bracelets, and a ring. The relationship between the woman and the child is not made explicitly clear, but she appears to be a hired caretaker.  The title of the postcard is “Negro Woman and Child,” and is written in French, English, Spanish, and Italian. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard is, like many other postcards published by Salon de Paris, meant to convey a sense of romantic nostalgia. Romantic nostalgia that, in this case, serves to promote notions of benevolent paternalism as well as other racialized and gendered narratives. A common narrative is that Black women not only enjoy, but prefer to care for white children - a sentiment that is clearly invoked here. The woman’s attire also clearly marks her as an exoticized figure; perhaps she is meant to be an immigrant woman who is caring for the child of her white employer. This kind of cross-racial child care and domestic work is often seen as a status symbol for the white employers (hence the emphasis on the orientalist view of this woman). There is nothing about this illustration that would suggest that the image is supposed to be perceived as humorous.","analysis":"This postcard is, like many other postcards published by Salon de Paris, meant to convey a sense of romantic nostalgia.

He is barefoot. He is looking away without engaging the viewer. The dogs are watching him. He is standing outside, possibly near a fence as the foreground is sandy while the background has trees. The postcard contains the caption “Dog Keeper.” at the bottom of the image. The image is vertical making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is not visible. This postcard is part of a series of postcards depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian dog keeper. We do not know if the man illustrated actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of an Indian man-servant would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nAccording to European gender roles, the Indian servant is performing feminine tasks, and by ethnographically representing Indian men in this manner, the British audience is inclined to assume he, and thus all Indian men, are effeminate. This is supported by this barefootedness.\nMessage: n/a","analysis":"This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian dog keeper.

The black and brown stroller in front of her has the hood down so that the white baby inside, dressed in white fabric, is visible. The scene takes place in a lakeside environment.

The words “Our Servants” are centered at the top. In the drawing, a white woman, whom a viewer may presume is a middle- or upper-class woman looking for a white working-class maidservant to employ, is bending down in a registry office as she beholds a row of uncongenial-looking candidates. In spite of her quest to find a servant, however, she is bending at the waist with her hands clasped together in front of her as though lacking confidence and almost beseeching the stern-faced servants to select her as their employer instead. Standing adjacent from their potential mistress, the female domestic servants all appraise the demure lady with an almost contemptuous glare while some cross their hands over their chest, their statures being greater than the dainty middle-class woman to further suggest that it is they who wield the power in this transaction. These servants are dressed in elaborate scarves, hats, and often dresses that largely resemble the attire of the lady seeking a domestic.\n\nAnalysis: This image is meant to convey a role reversal between female employers of domestics in British households and the female servants they chose between.\nThis illustrated British postcard satirizes relationships between middle-class white mistresses and their working-class white female maidservants by placing the latter in a position of entitlement relative to their potential employer. In a comic role-reversal, the middle-class mistress bends at the waist and claps her hands demurely as she stands facing a row of coarse-looking servants of fancy attire, harkening back to class anxieties that working-class maidservants made themselves indistinguishable from their middle-class mistresses.   The text “Choosing A Mistress” hints, in the illustration, the coarse-looking woman is actually a white domestic servant deciding which mistress she would like to essentially “hire” as her employer. This postcard would be humorous to a contemporary viewer because white, predominantly female domestic servants in Britain—often called “Bridgets” if Irish immigrants, as the orange-haired servant could very well be—were considered pompous and entitled, trying to negotiate working contracts and conditions, ask employers for time off on Catholic feast days or holidays, and were notorious quitting a domestic position if it was not to their liking. Since employers in this often undervalued profession were accustomed to setting the rules, they seldom took kindly to white domestic servants’ self-advocacy. Accordingly, the illustration’s servant occupies the role of domineering mistress herself, while the true mistresses in turn are cowed into submission and subject to the domestic’s critical eye. This postcard also offers commentary on the pervasive concern among middle-class women that their Irish immigrant domestic workers often purchased attire befitting an upper-class status with their salaries and would be thus mistaken for their mistresses. In order to diffuse this worry, this postcard illustration derides the servant’s attempt to adopt the clothing of the mistresses, whom still markedly outshine her mis-matched outfit despite likely hailing from a rural, impoverished place in Ireland like many of the so-called “Bridgets.” \nAnother interpretation of this postcard is that the domestics are indeed the women that comprise the row in the illustration, but are called mistresses due to their adoption of finery that surpasses the comparatively ridiculous clothing of the true mistress. It was due to the common race and gender of the domestic servants that presented this problem of being equated with their mistresses, who relied upon them to bolster their status rather than to call it into question. One’s clothing was also regarded as an indication of one’s moral hygiene as well, so if a domestic servant dressed better than her mistress, the narrative of Englishwomen’s moral superiority could also be called into question. \n \nAnalysis: TBC; this is currently copied and pasted without revision from a similar postcard!

The man also has a brown leather sling across his shoulder, though the image cuts off what may be attached to it. The picture is labeled with the signature “E.E.M” as well as “Aquarette.” It also includes a caption titled “Govind Sing, Rajpoot Shikaree (Hunter).” The back of the postcard is split back, including a space of a message, address, and stamp.

The label of “Hunter” enables the viewer to understand that  purpose is to provide a visual representation of what an Indian hunter may look like.

As a “type” postcard, it is enabling the audience to have an understanding of what an Indian hunter looks like, and thus, what an Indian man looks like. In addition, the postcard label perpetuates the stereotype that Indian people, particularly men, work in domestic spheres. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, the categorization as “Hunter” not only serves to explain the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also to show the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of a servant for the sole purpose of hunting. In Britain, middle-class households could not  quantity of servants because the 1777 Servant Tax imposed a tax on men-servants in Britain as a result of the industrial revolution. Thus, this postcard could have been  boast  the British imperial household’s wealth. \nMoreover, the viewer must ask themselves, “is he always dressed like this or is he dressing up?” His bright red turban and immaculately clean shirt may have been how he dressed, however, it is arguable that his dress, particularly its coloring, was emphasized as a way to exoticisize him; how could he be hunting/laboring all day and be dressed so cleanly? That exoticization promotes the British ideals of imperialism and colonialism by othering the drawn Indian man, and more broadly Indians.","analysis":"The image depicts an Indian men-servant with the purpose of explaining his role in a British household.

This woman cleaning the floor is a working-class white maidservant, as indicated by her white bonnet, matching apron, and simple blue dress underneath. She is very beautiful and youthful by traditional American standards, with blonde hair falling to her shoulders in ringlets, with long eyelashes, and thin eyebrows raised in surprise as she looks behind her. A black and white cat is nudging her from the rear, but when one considers the text at the bottom of the postcard which reads “Please Sir, stop! -- Your wife will be back any minute!”, it appears that she has mistaken the feline for her male employer. Interestingly, her cheeks are blushing furiously at the perceived sexual advance and her mouth suggests that she is surprised, although not altogether daunted or unhappy by/with the occurrence. \n\nAnalysis: In this shockingly brazen postcard, which likely hails from the mid-20th century, a sexual liaison is heavily implied between the working-class white maidservant featured and her male employer. This is suggested through the woman’s mistaking the family cat as for her male employer as the feline rubs its head against her rear end, a very intimate and provocative gesture when initiated by a human. The woman does not appear to be in any rush to protest the act that she presumes comes from the head of the house, moreover, but instead blushes as though bashful while she simply bids her superior to stop so that his wife does not catch them in a state of sexual impropriety. Given these details, the postcard appears to not only fuel stereotypes about such domestics being promiscuous temptresses in their interactions with male employers, but also at common fears held by mistresses that their husbands would find such generally young maids to be more attractive and desirable. This postcard thus suggests the threat that white female domestics posed to their mistress’ authority and marriages that underpinned the supposed superior virtue of the middle- or upper-class homes in which they were employed. Of course, while the illustration might generate an outcry among viewers today for its underlying theme of sexual harassment by male employers that was in fact a common threat for domestic servants such as the woman portrayed, it is clear that this postcard was intended to produce more of a comedic effect among its contemporary audience due to the presence of a cat mistaken for the domestic’s male employer and because the affections of what the domestic believes to be the male employer seem to be reciprocated. Through this intentional choice, the white working-class maidservant is depicted as complicit in this sexual impropriety rather than a victim who would have likely faced mental distress in reality from an employer’s usually unwanted advances. \n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard contains neither message nor address and is not postmarked. This indicates that the postcard was never sent, although it was perhaps hand-delivered to a recipient or saved for a personal collection by a purchaser.","analysis":"In this shockingly brazen postcard, which likely hails from the mid-20th century, a sexual liaison is heavily implied between the working-class white maidservant featured and her male employer.

Her intelligence is further diminished by her misunderstanding of common middle-class household objects, which the contemporary viewer would have found both humorous and self-validating. In the case of this postcard, the servants’ characterization was likely intended to appeal to middle class women who employed Irish maidservants, as this affirmed middle class women’s perception of superiority over their workers. Anxiety circulated about women’s roles and class disparity within those gender roles at the time of this postcard’s circulation. The “Irish Bridget” was a stereotype used to describe female domestic servants who immigrated to the US from Ireland between the 1840s and 1930s. This caricatured figure got its name from an important Irish catholic figure, Saint Brigid, which was also a popular name for girls in the mid-19th century. Irish maid servants were privately hired by the heads of households in urban American settings, with whom they typically lived throughout their time of employment as domestic workers. It was extremely common for middle-class white Americans in the urban east to hire an Irish servant as a means of displaying their social status and to assert the family’s position within the refinement of a growing middle class. The idea of “refinement” was defined, in part, by positioning oneself in moral opposition to another group. Irish maidservants served as a scapegoat for this moral opposition, and thus the “Bridget” caricature was developed. One major way that a family’s respectability was assessed was based on their adherence to (Protestant) Christian morality. Irish immigrants, being primarily Catholic, were therefore automatically othered. In order to cast-out Irish immigrants, “Bridget” could be portrayed as unintelligent, lazy, ignorant, pretentious, defiant, demanding, and unaware of the parameters of their social status. In the image depicted above, the Irish servant is characterized as the unintelligent and ignorant “Bridget”. \n\nThis postcard was sent to a Miss Alice Chadwich in [illegible] Somerville, Maine.

The image shows an older white woman making praline candies in the kitchen of a small praline shop. Behind her is a towering figure of a Black woman - whether she is meant to be a living person or a doll is unclear. The white woman is carefully making her candies - taking the praline from the stovetop and laying them out to be baked. The Black woman is peculiar, in that her skin tone is not that of a real person: it is edited to be a jarringly deep black. On her face are large cartoon eyes, thick red lips, and a triangle nose. While the white woman wears an off-white button-down chef’s coat, the Black woman is wearing a plain red dress with a white apron. The white apron has text embroidered into it: “Pralines visit-our candy-kitchen and-patio free-samples.” The Black woman is also wearing a knotted red headdress with a yellow design pattern; she is also wearing large, gold hoop earrings. Behind the Black woman are shelves. On top of the highest shelf are four dolls who look strikingly similar to the tall Black figure: the cartoon face and deep Black skin. The only real difference between the dolls and the woman are the specifics of their outfits. The title of the postcard reads, “Praline Candy Making, New Orleans, La.” On the verso of the card is a caption that says, “Praline Candy Making in New Orleans,” with subtext that reads, “New Orleans, famous for its delicious pralines the world over. They can be bought in several flavors in any of the dozens of Gift Shops in the French Quarter.” \n\nAnalysis: The most striking part of this image is the uncanny skin color and facial features of the Black woman in the center of the postcard. If she is meant to be a living human, then her features are meant to set a strict binary between Black people and white people: binary in skin tone, binary in humanity. Perhaps, however, she is meant to be a doll - a life-sized figure meant to be put outside of the candy shop as an advertising sign. Regardless, the figure is clearly racialized in a dehumanizing way. Her plain dress is mean to signify her relatively low place on the socio-economic ladder; and her headdress is meant to remind the viewer of her “exotic,” and “otherized” heritage as a Black woman. It is also important to note that pralines candies are often associated with the Black population of New Orleans; the candy is cheap to produce, and Black women are often depicted as selling their homemade candies on the street. In this way, the postcard company is profiting from this stereotype (by selling the postcard with this image) in the same way that the white shopkeeper in the image is capitalizing on the “exotic,” and “exciting” conflation of Black culture and praline candies (by advertising using racialized figures).","analysis":"The most striking part of this image is the uncanny skin color and facial features of the Black woman in the center of the postcard.

He is holding something in his left hand, maybe a pom pom. The postcard is captioned “Birthday Greetings” at the top right corner. The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. This postcard is part of a series of birthday cards. \nAnalysis: The white-bordered birthday postcard from the early 1900s reproduces the eighteenth century European portraiture tradition of using an ornately attired black servant boy as a status symbol in white portraits. \nThe man’s dark skin allows the viewer to hypothesize that he is of African descent, however, his exact place of origin is deliberately left ambiguous. He both racialized and exoticized at the same time. The purpose of including him in the postcard seems to be Oriental ornamentation. His presence and dark skin is used as a foil to highlight the lady’s immaculate whiteness, shyness, and femininity. Moreover, his placement in the postcard, behind the white girl, supports his ornamentation; he is not the main subject of the image, but the image and story would be incomplete without him. The postcard follows the long tradition of European portraiture that depicted black and brown “boys” serving white mistresses, while leaving their provenance unclear. This racialization and exoticization supports the values of New Imperialism, where Western nations expanded their empires into Africa and Asia, and as a result, had access to labor from those people. These values are so relevant that even though it was a Birthday Greetings postcard, the normalization of racialization and colonization is portrayed in a birthday card.  \nMessage: The message on the verso says “To Emily From Jillie” meaning it was sent as a birthday card.","analysis":"The white-bordered birthday postcard from the early 1900s reproduces the eighteenth century European portraiture tradition of using an ornately attired black servant boy as a status symbol in white portraits. \nThe man’s dark skin allows the viewer to hypothesize that he is of African descent, however, his exact place of origin is deliberately left ambiguous.

The focus is on the ayah’s head. She wears her hair back in a traditional bun, which showcases the seven earrings in her ear. Her ear is so decorated with jewelry that it is weighed down. Her nose features similar ornate jewelry, with three nose pieces, as she looks placidly off-camera. Around her neck is a similar over-the-top stacking of jewelry: she wears one tight choker necklace, one pearl necklace, and about five other necklaces that are made of cowrie shells. The varying lengths of the necklaces create an aesthetically pleasing stack. She wears a short sleeved light blouse with her sari wrapped around her stomach in a way that was typical of the working class.\nAnalysis: In cutting this photograph as a bust level, the goal is to heavily exoticize the ayah. For her daily life as a domestic servant, this inordinate amount of jewelry simply wouldn’t be practical.

His drawings featured in numerous national publications for over thirty years.","description":"This postcard, which has a blue background accompanied by figures sketched with black lines as though from a pen, features a working-class white maidservant in a modest blouse and skirt that conceals her footwear. She is standing in a domestic space, presumably a home parlor of her employer’s house, with myriad family pictures resting atop a bookshelf on the back wall visible to the viewer and with other toys strewn about the floor. Toward the right-hand side of the postcard, four children are walking beside their father, playing with toys and with one grabbing their parent’s overcoat. The father, looking none too pleased with their boisterous conduct, is bent over in with his hands placed on the children before him as though shooing them out of the room. As he does this, his upper torso is half-turned in the maid’s direction while he fixes her with a stern glare, as if to reprimand her for standing by at ease as he struggles to control his young. The bottom of the postcard reads “Papa and the New Governess.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard’s depiction of a white working-class maidservant hints that such laborers routinely shirk their responsibilities to look after the children in their care and keep an orderly house as expected. After all, the illustrator shows the domestic failing to take action as the male employer is bombarded by his children and looks to his employee in vain for support. Governesses were tasked even more so than other household servants to look after and educate an employer’s children, a role which the white woman featured in this postcard is clearly neglecting to fulfill. Stereotypes promulgated during especially the late 19th and early 20th centuries dismissed such domestics as indolent and accused them in part of fomenting the perceived “servant problem” in North America and Britain during this time, which decried a supposed shortage of competent, industrious domestic workers. Such assertions also encouraged some employers to turn to other demographics for domestic servitude in subsequent decades of the 1900s, such as black women who migrated from the Jim Crow South to northern urban centers in hopes for better employment opportunities and less racial discrimination. On another note, it is possible that this illustration is also designed to hint at the threat that youthful white female domestics could pose in undermining the marital sanctity that underpinned such domestic spaces generally regarded as inviolable safe havens of American or European virtue. The lady in the house is nowhere to be seen and the male employer is left alone with this putatively lazy but nevertheless attractive young female worker who has invaded the domestic realm and is now entrusted with taking care of the man’s children as well. The caption “Papa and the new governess” might further hint at some sense of attraction or relationship between the two figures. Mistresses often worried that female domestics’ time alone with their children and husbands would render their status as mothers and the women wielding authority in the household as obsolete, or even cause their spouse’s affections to stray and thence undermine the reported morality of their family/home.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard is hard to decipher, but it appears that the postcard’s sender was asking the intended recipient when he or she wished to pay a visit, followed by some updates on the sender’s relations. Ultimately, the message seems to be unrelated to the postcard’s illustration. The address is similarly unintelligible.","analysis":"This postcard’s depiction of a white working-class maidservant hints that such laborers routinely shirk their responsibilities to look after the children in their care and keep an orderly house as expected.

The young girl is surrounded by suitcases and bags which fill the right half of the composition where she stands, holding an umbrella and wearing a hat, as well. Behind the cracked door, a small man crouches while observing the interaction between the girl and the woman. At the bottom of the illustration, a block of text reads “The Servant and How to Train Her No. 1 ‘Take an interest in her when she arrives: let the Mistress do this, as the Master of the house will probably prefer not to be noticed.’” \n\nAnalysis: This series was meant to prepare an employer with a set of frustrating mistakes to be made by their newly hired domestic servants, as well as how to contend with these issues. The sequenced cartoons are explained via the text at the bottom of the composition, as if directly addressing a hiring mistress with words of advice. The illustrations depict caricatures of young domestic workers in a way that the contemporary viewer would have found humorous. The postcard shown here is part of a complete six-piece series. The first illustration of the series shows the arrival of a young girl who can presumably be identified as an Irish immigrant based on her red hair, cumbersome luggage, and ill-fitted clothing which suggests her state of poverty. While this illustration may have racialized undertones of Irish characteristics, the contemporary viewer could have related to the scenario regardless of their servant’s ethnicity. Working-class families throughout Great Britain often sent their young daughters (aged 15-20) to work as live-in domestic servants in order to supplement income deficits. The text functions as a way to communicate proper employer-to-servant relationships. The female head of household interacted more often with her maid servant, as it was seen as improper for the male head of household to have too close contact with a forgein woman in their home. Such interactions could raise suspicions of sexual impropriety or a competition between the mistress and the servant for the male’s attention/affection. These anxieties were also particularly associated with Irish domestic servants, as their predominantly Catholic affiliations were thought to threaten Protestant senses of conservative morality.  \n\nThis postcard was sent to a Miss P Hurcombe, courtesy of a Miss Braund at Prospect Road in Prospect, Australia. The message reads, “Can you find room in your book for this. (sic) No news worth troubling the press about at present. They tell me Vardon beat O’Loghlin. With love from U. No. Who. (sic)” The names mentioned in this message likely refer to Australian politicians Joseph Vardon and James O’Loghlin who competed for a seat in the Australian Senate in 1907 to 1908. O'Loughlin's informal appointment was declared void after Vardon petitioned, and a new election was held in February of 1908, when this card was postmarked.

Mitchell Publishing","companyInformation":null,"description":"The scene depicted is of an older Black woman sitting on a porch outside of a wooden home. Behind her are gray wooden planks, and a few sunflowers off to the woman’s left. The sitting woman is dressed in an orange dress with white vertical stripes, a red and yellow knotted head dress, and a pair of small glasses. She is looking off into the distance - off to the right. Her smile is wide, her red lips spread enough to show that she only has two teeth. Both of her hands are holding a seeded watermelon slice, the length of which almost doubles her shoulder width. The title, written in orange lettering at the top of the postcard, reads, “610 - One of the good things grown in California.” \nAnalysis: The most obvious part of the illustration is the comically large watermelon that the older woman is eating. Presumably, the pairing of a Black person and a watermelon pays homage to the stereotype of Black people loving watermelon; this stereotype is utilized in an effort to celebrate California’s triumph in the industrialization of their agricultural programs in the Progressive Era. Among other aspects of her person that are racialized for comic effect are her teeth and lips. Her lack of a full set of teeth are meant to illustrate her poverty, uncivil nature, lack of hygiene, and overall lesser position on the socio-economic ladder; her large, red lips are common in depictions of Black people and are used to racialize her further. The woman’s attire is modest and without accent, likely to illustrate her lesser economic position (a position she is presumed to share with other Black people). Her body is approximate to any contemporary individual’s conception of the Mammy: desexualized entirely, with an emphasis on her almost masculinized stature and shape (a shape that would be perceived as strange if given to a white woman). The headdress she wears is typical of a racialized (almost exoticized) depiction of a Black woman; although distinctly American, she still retains some facets of her exoticized, otherized heritage. \nMessage: Alongside the address (labeled as going to Seattle, Washington) is a message reading, “getting along nicely Sister [?] Mary.” This message seems to be unrelated to the image on the postcard. Despite there being no clear connection between the message and the postcard’s illustration, the sender of the postcard (likely a middle-class white person) is utilizing racialized imagery to convey a sense of comfort and nostalgia; the Mammy figure is often viewed with a sense of nostalgia, and is linked with notions of American progress and exceptionalism. Although the postcard is humorous in nature, there is an underlying sense of comfort - a comfort so palpable that the sender thought that this particular postcard was appropriate accompanying her message that things are going well for her.","analysis":"The most obvious part of the illustration is the comically large watermelon that the older woman is eating.

Beyond the wall where they are partaking in this questionable liaison, narrowly concealed from the sight of onlookers, two women in finery such as fancy necklaces and dresses are seated. They both seem quite old compared to the maid and are markedly less thin. They hold what are likely tea cups on their laps and turn to one another as if conversing. The text that features at the top of this postcard comes from one of those women, who remarks to her guest, “I have so much trouble with the maids[.] Charles is never satisfied.” \n\nAnalysis: This postcard capitalizes on the pervasive fear among mistresses that their employed female domestics would be regarded as more beautiful and desirable than themselves, essentially luring away their husbands with their youthful, purported seductive natures. The supposed legitimacy of those concerns is evidenced here by the clearly sexual interaction between a working-class white maidservant and her male employer just beyond the sight of who a viewer can presume is the lady of the house and a female guest whom she has invited in for tea. White female domestic servants were often viewed as willful seductresses when interacting with their employers, and Irish “Bridgets”—whom the domestic featured in this postcard may represent given her stereotypical hair color—were especially targets of such demeaning perceptions.\n This depiction of the laborer as being a willing participant in the sexual liaison and even perhaps its initiator also preys upon societal fears around the time of the postcard’s production that such domestics would shatter the marital unity and Protestant values that underpinned the supposed superior virtue and sanctity of higher-class British households. The domestic is also shirking the responsibilities of her occupation in her choice to engage in this improper relationship instead, so this postcard also propounds commonly-held notions of such domestics being lazy and negligent with their work. The threat posed to the mistress’ desirability and authority--along with her household’s morality overall--is manifest all the more in the text accompanying the illustration, which hints that the male employer has already entered into affairs with numerous female domestics, hence the reason why he appears to always alternate. His wife’s unwitting statement that he is “never satisfied” thus assumes a double meaning, one of which carrying much darker sexual implications designed to give contemporary viewers a good laugh at the expense of the maid’s perceived dignity and respectability.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Ges [sic] who.

The floor is made of a light wood, a red curtain separates rooms in the back, and, apart from a singular pot, the room is otherwise unfurnished. The focus of the image has been labeled “Madrassi Ayah”, referring to a nursemaid from the Madras region of Southern India. The woman sits on the floor with one arm around her legs and one on the floor, in a manner typically seen with native servants. She looks off to her right, which is also typical of many of these postcards. She wears a purple cotton sari with a red blouse underneath, along with minimal jewelry like rings, bracelets, and a necklace. \nAnalysis: While it is painted, the postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on a singular character, who is homogenized under whatever text label is at the bottom, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization. In other words, by refusing to give this woman her name and simply label her as “Madrassi Ayah,” this woman is a romanticized representation used by the West to identify all others who serve a similar role. The intention behind this colonial imagery was to show a constructed illusion of natives as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of the empire to the British public back home. The ayah’s passivity is emphasized in her inability to look directly at the viewer and her sitting posture. There is also an intention to desexualize this figure: with increasing anxiety in Britain about white purity and miscegenation, the intimate relationship the ayah had within the home became a sore point for the empire. Thus, the ayah was depicted as intentionally plain, so as to negate any suspicions of impropriety and erase the long history of sexual exploitation within Indian domestic service. \nMessage: None.","analysis":"While it is painted, the postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on a singular character, who is homogenized under whatever text label is at the bottom, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization.

The title of the postcard summarizes the scene as saying: “Old-Fashioned Southern Kitchen and Negro Mammy.” The image shows the woman standing next to her fireplace and steel oven. She is handling a pot while looking directly at the observer with a reluctant smile. The scene is modest, with a brick fireplace, wooden board walls, and modest appliances. Her attire, too, is simple: she is wearing a green shawl, a white apron with blue dots, and a knotted headdress of a similar style. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard’s depiction of a modest Mammy figure is a very common caricaturization of the time: the modest home, white apron, headdress, and perpetual domestic labor. Even when the Mammy is at home, she is still performing her work (in this case, by cooking), which means to show that the Mammy cannot be separated from the Black women with whom the stereotype is associated - for they are one in the same. Her apron, too, is indicative of her labor as a domestic servant. The woman’s headdress is a common detail for depictions and caricatures of Black woman; it is meant to be evocative of the woman’s heritage as an “exotic,” “otherized” individual. It is important to note that, although this is a photographic image, this postcard cannot be taken as a true-to-life representation of Black women and their homes. Oftentimes, photographs are staged to convey a certain narrative; the hand-tinting process, too, is often done in a certain way to prove a particular narrative.

(Indian Nurse.)” and is part of a set called the “Grano Series,” according to the back of the card. The setting is outdoor; while the black and white makes it difficult to see, it seems to be a garden setting. Two guards hold a palanquin with a white child within it. A palanquin is a vehicle used traditionally in India, usually by the upper class, where a swing seat is extended with sticks that can be carried by servants, allowing the sitter to be elevated from the ground. The guards wear turbans and uniforms and the seated child wears white with some kind of ornate hat. In front of the carriage is the ayah carrying another white baby; both parties are dressed in white attire. The ayah wears the white shawl covering her hair and shoulders, commonly worn by ayahs, with a pleated skirt and shoes. The baby wears a white dress and a sunhat. \nAnalysis: This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet to the daily life of an ayah and her white wards, as though the viewer had stumbled on the scene naturally occurring. These glimpses into the everyday life of ethnic servants served convey Western influence in the colonies, especially the nature of interracial relations. The relationship between ayah and her white ward is one of the most intimate of interracial living, and postcards such as this one would have allowed for those back home to witness a glimpse of how comfortable each party was with one another. In presenting this as the norm, the postcard also accomplishes a solidification of the hierarchy of races: this postcard helps to normalize natives as domestic servants for white people. Both children are being carried by adults, suggesting that even children are superior to Indian adults in the British empire. While both ayah and child are pictured as having a close relationship, the postcard does not lose sight of the power dynamics between both races. \nMessage: None.","analysis":"This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet to the daily life of an ayah and her white wards, as though the viewer had stumbled on the scene naturally occurring.

She is looking off wistfully past the camera. The seriousness of the image lends the postcard an almost anthropological feel. The woman is wearing a knotted yellow headdress with red rhombuses. She wears gold hoop earrings. The woman is also wearing a white kerchief and a blue blouse with white and yellow vertical stripes. Her face is a dull monochrome, except for her bright red lips and blueish eyes. The background of the postcard is gray. The postcard is titled, “Mammy,” and appears to be one of a series. \n\nAnalysis: Although this postcard is not meant to be comical, it shows off the “funny” facets of the time’s stereotype of the Mammy. The woman is older and desexualized. The look on her face appears to be pensive and thoughtful - attributes often given to the stereotypical Mammy. Her bright, knotted headdress and her gold earrings are meant to be evocative of her heritage as an “exotic” and “otherized” racial group. The accentuation of her red lips is also common for caricatures of Black people, and is meant to point to a distinct phenotypic difference between the Black and white racial groups. Her kerchief and dress are common adornments for people of a relatively lower socio-economic status; her clothing also denotes her role as a domestic worker. The anthropological tone of this image is meant to convey a sense of factuality, when in reality the photographer and printer have a lot of influence on the image; it is not at all uncommon for photographers to stage and dress their subjects in particular (stereotypical) ways, and for printers to accentuate certain aspects of a subject with color. \n\nMessage: This postcard was sent from Augusta, Georgia to Springfield, Massachusetts. The message is largely unintelligible, but the few words that can be made out (“suffering,” “beautiful life”) along with the length of the message indicate that it has a serious tone.

A clothesline behind her indicates that she was perhaps in the middle of drying clothes taken from a basket on the ground behind her until she was met by her employer. The male employer’s status is denoted by his overcoat, suit and other formal attire along with a top hat, while her subordinate position is legible through her white bonnet, frilly white apron, and plain black dress underneath. The employer, who is bespectacled and likely markedly older than the maid given his thinning hair underneath the top hat and the wrinkles outlining his forehead, reaches out his hands to caress the chin and waist of the maid before him. Rather than resist his advances, the maidservant leans in and looks him in the eye with a faint smile, passively submitting to his fond gestures. A comment bubble extends from his mouth reading “Kiss me dear Jane,” and the text on the bottom of the postcard reads as follows, written from the perspective of an unnamed witness to this scene: “I was in the garden, where Master kissed his servant girl one day. And as he drew her to him, thought a compliment he’d pay. ‘Your kisses are much sweeter than your mistress’es you know.’ And she simply simpered ‘Yus sir, the gardener told me so.’” \n\n\nAnalysis: This postcard depicts a male employer clearly violating the personal space of a domestic servant as she attempts to go about drying the clothes belonging to her employer’s family. His gesture holds clear sexual undertones which are made explicit through his demand that the domestic kiss him, capitalizing on the pervasive fear among mistresses that their employed female domestic servants would be regarded as more beautiful and desirable than themselves, essentially luring away their husbands with their youthful, purported seductive natures. This depiction of the laborer also preys upon societal fears around the time of the postcard’s production that such domestics would shatter the marital unity and Protestant values that underpinned the supposed superior virtue and sanctity of higher-class British households. White female domestic servants were often viewed as willful seductresses when interacting with their employers, and Irish “Bridgets”—whom the domestic featured in this postcard may represent given her stereotypical hair color—were especially targets of such demeaning anxieties. This postcard attempts to offer validation for that stereotype by showing that, although the domestic is not necessarily the initiator of the improper scene unfolding with her male employer, she is clearly undaunted by his advances and the text hints that she has kissed him on prior occasions. The text also mocks this domestic servant for her supposed promiscuity by suggesting that she has also engaged in inappropriate contact with the gardener, a revelation that was likely meant to garner laughter from a contemporary viewer. The domestic is also shirking the responsibilities of her occupation in apparently consenting to this interaction with her employer, and in this way, this postcard also propounds the commonly held notions of such domestics being lazy and negligent with their work. Of course, while the illustration might generate an outcry among viewers today for its underlying theme of sexual harassment by male employers that was in fact a common threat for domestic servants such as the woman portrayed, it is clear that this postcard was intended to produce more of a comedic effect among its contemporary audience since the affections of the male employer seem to be reciprocated. Through this intentional choice, the white working-class maidservant is depicted as complicit in this sexual impropriety rather than a victim who would have likely faced mental distress in reality from an employer’s usually unwanted advances.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard contains no message or address, nor any postmark.

John Valentine founded his printing and photography business in 1851, and his son expanded it. By the end of the 19th century, Valentine & Sons had expanded from Scotland to Great Britain, New Zealand, Jamaica, Morocco, in order to market images of popular tourist destinations from those regions. Valentine & Sons entered the picture postcard market in 1898 and continued to grow the business until the 1970 when they halted the production of postcards altogether.

She is wearing a long skirt, fitted jacket with a collar and cuffs, brown gloves, black heels, a feathered hat, and she clutches a frilly umbrella under one of her arms. A trunk full of clothes lays open behind her with the garments strewn haphazardly within it. An additional hat hangs on a wooden chair beside the trunk, and a dresser sits to the left of it. At the bottom of the illustration, a block of text reads “The Servant and How to Train Her- ‘Encourage her to take a pride in her personal appearance: this will develop her natural taste for refinement in her dress.’” \n\nAnalysis: This series was meant to prepare an employer with a set of frustrating mistakes to be made by their newly hired domestic servants, as well as how to contend with these issues.

The illustrations depict caricatures of young domestic workers in a way that the contemporary viewer would have found humorous. The postcard shown here is part of a complete six-piece series. The fourth illustration of the series shows a domestic servant dressed in an outfit that sharply contrasts her attire upon arriving at her employer’s home (see “The Servant and How to Train Her No. 1). In the series’ first illustration, the young servant wore ill-fitting work clothes. This illustration therefore shows her refinement in taste. The text, which instructs the employer to encourage the illustrated behavior, may be interpreted as a slight against Irish domestic workers who were often criticized for their preferences towards middle-class styles. The tendency for Irish workers to dress in attire that made them indistinguishable from their employers raised anxieties for the middle class about blurring class lines, which would topple the carefully constructed power imbalance between employers and their servants. \n\nThis postcard was mailed to one Master W.

The cards were photographed in black and white and hand-tinted in Germany and Britain.","description":"A hand-tinted photographic postcard of an Indian man dressed in a mustard yellow shirt and light blue pants creating a flower arrangement. He is also wearing a white and red turban and is barefoot. He is on the brick stoop of a house squatting and taking care of flowers. He is creating bouquets of flowers that appear to be wildflowers as they were collected in a woven basket. There are also tools of his trade in the photograph. In the background, there is a green bush, a wooden barrel, and a brown, wooden front door. The postcard contains the caption “MALEE (GARDENER).” The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. This postcard was “Printed in Germany” and is part of a series of postcards by Moorli Dhur & Sons depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian gardener called Malee. We do not know if the man photographed actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe image on the postcard would have been a black and white photograph that was later hand painted into color, known as a hand-tinted photograph. As a hand-tinted work, the artist had discretion over the colors used, and his bright white, blemish-free clothes may have been how he dressed, however, it is arguable that his dress, particularly its coloring, was emphasized as a way to exoticisize him; how could he be laboring all day as a server and be dressed so neatly and brightly?\nBy picturing him with bare feet, Indian attire, and a turban, he is incredibly different from the British man. That juxtaposition exoticizes the Indian man and also leads to an association between his status as a colonized man and his domestic work. The man is emasculated through his stance and bare feet, and his domestic work, particularly his work with flowers which would be women’s work in Britain. By emasculating him, British men are masculinized which reinforces the perceived importance of the British colonizing mission.\nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of an Indian manservant would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nThis postcard is part of a set of postcards illustrating different types of men-servants in British imperial India. It is labeled “1356” on the verso.\nMessage: The only word on the backside of the postcard is “Mother.” Without a postmark or a stamp, it can be assumed that the word is not a message meant to be sent, but maybe the name of an owner or reseller.","analysis":"This is an ethnographic “type” postcard.

She wears her hair back in a traditional bun, which showcases the seven earrings in her ear. Her ear is so decorated with jewelry that it is weighed down. Her nose features similar ornate jewelry, with three nose pieces, as she looks placidly off-camera. Around her neck is a similar over-the-top stacking of jewelry: she wears one tight choker necklace, one pearl necklace, and about five other necklaces that are made of cowrie shells. The varying lengths of the necklaces create an aesthetically pleasing stack. She wears a short sleeved light blouse with her sari wrapped around her stomach in a way that was typical of the working class. Her ankles have belled anklets and she wears several toe rings. \nAnalysis: The goal of this image is to heavily exoticize the ayah. For her daily life as a domestic servant, this inordinate amount of jewelry simply wouldn’t be practical. But ayahs in the British empire served as status symbols: by presenting the ayah in the most ornate and exoticized manner possible, the postcard actually argues for the wealth of the empire and her British employers rather than the ayah herself. This postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is the singular ayah, homogenized under the ayah label at the top, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization. Tamilian ayahs in particular were in high demand, as they were said to have the most British influence out of the ethnic groups and would therefore be the easiest to comply in the household. In labeling this woman as “Tamil Ayah” without a name, she is denied identity and forced to embody a white construction of the Indian race. The intention behind this colonial imagery was to show a constructed illusion of natives as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of the empire to the British public back home. The ayah’s passivity is emphasized in her inability to look directly at the viewer. There is also an intention to desexualize this figure: with increasing anxiety in Britain about white purity and miscegenation, the intimate relationship the ayah had within the home became a sore point for the empire. Thus, the ayah was depicted as intentionally plain-looking, so as to negate any suspicions of impropriety and erase the long history of sexual exploitation within Indian domestic service.\nMessage: “Thanks very much for letter—Glad you liked the [unintelligible].

His status is denoted by his advanced age in relation to the maid and his bowtie and other fancy attire, while the maid is wearing a white bonnet and matching white apron with a simple black dress underneath. The pair are both blushing, and the maid appears to enjoy the man’s advances, as she has a faint smile on her face and is nearly closing her eyes. In her hands, a tray with teacups and other containers tilt precariously due to the inappropriate contact betwixt the employer and his maid. In the doorway to the room, the presumable mistress of the house stands erect in utter shock while two children’s faces peer out from behind her to witness the spectacle, their faces rosy as though either in anticipation for the scolding which their father is about to receive from their mother or out of sheer disbelief at the rare show of sexualized contact that they are beholding. The postcard is titled “Poor Pa’s Troubles” and further text appears at the bottom right of the postcard, reading “Pa gets into hot water” as though written from the perspective of the two children in the background.\n\nAnalysis: This postcard depicts a male employer clearly violating the personal space of a domestic servant as she attempts to go about her household duties. His fondling betrays his clear sexual designs, and the position of the shocked lady of the house in the background capitalizes on the pervasive fear among mistresses that their employed female domestics would be regarded as more beautiful and desirable than themselves, essentially luring away their husbands with their youthful, purported seductive natures. This depiction of the laborer also preys upon societal fears around the time of the postcard’s production that such domestics would shatter the marital unity and Protestant values that underpinned the supposed superior virtue and sanctity of higher-class British households. White female domestic servants were often viewed as willful seductresses when interacting with their employers, and this perception is validated by this postcard through the clear blushing of the domestic and her closed eyes as she readily submits herself to the advances of her male employer. The domestic is also shirking the responsibilities of her occupation in apparently consenting to this interaction with her employer, and in this way, this postcard also propounds the commonly held notions of such domestics being lazy and negligent with their work. Of course, while the illustration might generate an outcry among viewers today for its underlying theme of sexual harassment by male employers that was in fact a common threat for domestic servants such as the woman portrayed, it is clear that this postcard was intended to produce more of a comedic effect among its contemporary audience since the affections of the male employer seem to be reciprocated. Through this intentional choice, the white working-class maidservant is depicted as complicit in this sexual impropriety rather than a victim who would have likely faced mental distress in reality from an employer’s usually unwanted advances. Finally, it is important to note that in this postcard, the appearance of two children beholding the spectacle of sexual impropriety also hints that by their infiltration of hallowed American domestic spaces, such domestics were threatening to corrupt the morals of the young placed within their charge. \n\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Hello Lula! We are all feeling better & hope you are all well. Mama spoke of Uncle Jim & Papa a coming up, they had better come, we have been working for Uncle Jim now every day must tell him I want him to be sure & come for he could not do much now if he was home.

He is also wearing a white turban. He is barefoot. He is standing and looking away without engaging the viewer. Over his left shoulder, he holds a goat skin bag that is pouring water over a cluster of potted plants. The man is standing outside a building, presumably a house, in front of an archway that is covered by a cloth. The postcard contains the caption “BHISTEE (WATER CARRIER).” The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. This postcard was “Printed in Germany” and is part of a series of postcards by Moorli Dhur & Sons depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian water carrier called Bhistee. We do not know if the man photographed actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe image on the postcard would have been a black and white photograph that was later hand painted into color, known as a hand-tinted photograph. As a hand-tinted work, the artist had discretion over the colors used, and his bright, blemish-free clothes may have been how he dressed, however, it is arguable that his dress, particularly its coloring, was emphasized as a way to exoticisize him; how could he be laboring all day and be dressed so neatly and brightly? \nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like.

The Black woman is bathing the white, red-headed girl in a wooden tub; the dog comes in seemingly unexpectedly and the woman has to block the nude child from the dog’s view with a towel. The dog gawks at the naked child with his eyes wide open and his tongue hanging out of his mouth. The Black woman, who is blocking the child with a white bathing towel, appears horrified by the entrance of the dog. The child is standing upright - her feet submerged in the water - and is looking over her shoulder in the direction of the dog (it is not clear, however, if she is aware of the dog’s presence, or is simply looking in the direction of the commotion). The title of this postcard is half in French and half in English: “L’indiscret [the indiscreet]. Go away naughty boy.” \n\nAnalysis: This postcard’s caricatured illustration of the Black woman is very common for racialized contemporary depictions; her wide (almost masculine) size and stature, her muscular build, her wide eyes and thick red lips. All of these details serve to paint the Black woman as one of a different, uncivilized, brutish race. Her attire, too, is meant to be evocative of her “exotic” heritage and her lesser socio-economic status; the yellow headdress she wears and her large, gold hoop earrings are meant to remind the viewer of her “quaint, quirky, wholly other” heritage; the woman’s modest dress, her rolled up sleeves, and her white apron signify her labor as a domestic servant. There is also a common racialized narrative seen in the Black woman’s caring for the white child. Black women are generally shown as preferring the white child over her own Black children, which contributes to the narrative of benevolent paternalism and whitewashes the nature of her labor. There is also a strange, almost sexual facet of this postcard’s illustration. The dog’s surprised, excited expression is meant to draw attention to the child's nudity - an attention that rules out innocent nakedness. The woman’s expression paired with the title, “Go Away Naughty Boy,” also hints to a non-innocent, invasive tone in the illustration. \n\nMessage: Although there is a message and address written on the verso of the card, they are faded to the point of being illegible.","analysis":"This postcard’s caricatured illustration of the Black woman is very common for racialized contemporary depictions; her wide (almost masculine) size and stature, her muscular build, her wide eyes and thick red lips.

The servant is also wearing earrings, a necklace and makeup. The servant is helping the white girl apply makeup. They are both on a rug with a black pillow on it. The postcard is captioned “THE FINISHING TOUCH” at the bottom of the image. The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation.

He is barefoot. He is handing a bouquet of flowers to a white mistress dressed in a full-coverage light blue dress and hair piece. She has an umbrella in her left hand and eye glasses in her right. They are standing outside on a path with greenery behind them. The postcard contains the caption “Mali, the Gardener.” The verso is not visible. This postcard is part of a series of postcards depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian gardener called Mali. We do not know if the man pictured actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nBy picturing him with bare feet, Indian attire, and a turban, he is incredibly different from the British man. That juxtaposition exoticizes the Indian man and also leads to an association between his status as a colonized man and his domestic work. The man is emasculated through his stance and bare feet, and his domestic work, particularly his work with flowers which would be women’s work in Britain. By emasculating him, British men are masculinized which reinforces the perceived importance of the British colonizing mission.\nThrough his posture, especially his stance as lower than the mistress, and his upward gaze, he is infantilitized. By portraying him as young, he is further emasculated which supported the men-servants work. The British audience could interpret that the men-servant is able to work in the home because there are no sexual threats to the chastity of the mistress since he is emasculate and infantile. His presence seems to be Oriental ornamentation. He is used as a foil to highlight the lady’s immaculate whiteness, femininity, and imperial power.\nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like.

Their endeavors were met with great success in the late 1800s and early 1900s, during the “postcard boom.”","description":"In this postcard, a middle-aged male employer in a tie and other formal apparel bends forward slightly in a domestic space as he reaches out one hand to appraise a working class white maidservant before him with rosy cheeks and a grin. The maidservant, who possesses either light brown or rusty hair and wears a white headpiece and apron that signify her status, bows her head demurely with her hands folded behind her back as though submitting to the employer’s touch. She is not returning his smile, however, but instead appears to be frowning slightly or else has an expression that is unreadable. On the left side of the postcard, across the room from these figures, a woman who the text reveals to be the man’s wife tilts her head down in a pout and looks forlornly at her husband and the maid. In some images featured on the far right-hand side of the postcard that appear to be separated from the components aforementioned, a woman who looks like the maid in the previous section of the illustration stands beside suitcases. The other figure on that side of the postcard appears to be a a white-haired man or woman walking toward the house instead of leaving, or perhaps just positioned as though facing the central scene described above. As a captain for the entire illustration, there is text that reads “Popular Plays. -- The Wife without a smile.” \n  \nAnalysis: Firstly, the male employer’s conduct in this postcard capitalizes on the pervasive fear among mistresses that their employed domestic servants would use their often youthful, purported seductive natures to shatter the marital unity and Protestant values that underpinned the supposed superior virtue of higher-class British households. White female domestic servants were often viewed as willful seductresses when interacting with their employers, and Irish “Bridgets”—whom the domestic featured in this postcard may represent given her stereotypical hair color—were especially targets of such demeaning British anxieties. Interestingly, however, the domestic servant is clearly not the initiator of any sexual impropriety toward her male employer—nor does she seem to be a consenting participant in his actions—but rather than scold her husband, the mistress chooses to punish this perceived dalliance by firing the maid. This hints at the seldom-acknowledged reality of sexual harassment that such domestics suffered at the hands of male employers and the prevalence of the aforementioned stereotypes about these servants that framed them as the immoral aggressors instead. In the smaller scenes on the right-hand side of the postcard, it is possible that the white-haired individual is either a new domestic to be employed in the household, likely selected for her advanced age and perceived as less of a threat in her beauty to the desirability of the mistress, or instead represents another man who is sneaking around to catch an improper glimpse of the young maid seen in the central part of the illustration. The individual’s face, after all, indicates that his or her gaze vector is aligned neatly with the buttock of the domestic servant, so this could be yet another indication of the way in which she and the domestics that she embodies were routinely sexualized.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Dear Maria, I was so very pleased to get your letter, but exceedingly sorry to hear that you & Sam have had a “tiff.” I hope he will not get a separation order; still dear keep on smiling, do not be like this one. With love from Lizzie.” The address is a bit hard to decipher, but it is clear that the recipient lives on a certain Springfield Road in Leicester, England. Upon examination, the personal message appears to relate directly to the content of the illustration, with the writer consoling the intended recipient amid a dispute she is engaged in with her husband. The writer is urging the recipient, named Maria, not to wear a discouraged frown like the mistress shown on the postcard’s front. In making this reference, this message is perhaps also intriguing for its hidden suggestion that the cause of Maria’s “tiff” with her spouse may derive from her husband’s extramarital affair with a female domestic servant.","analysis":"Firstly, the male employer’s conduct in this postcard capitalizes on the pervasive fear among mistresses that their employed domestic servants would use their often youthful, purported seductive natures to shatter the marital unity and Protestant values that underpinned the supposed superior virtue of higher-class British households.

The postcard itself is an advertisement for a brand of sweet condensed milk, with the remaining text at the bottom, written in Indonesian, being a conversation between baboe and her ward. \nAnalysis: This postcard occupies a unique position in that it brands itself as a postcard, but also functions as an advertisement for a company in the way that a tradecard might. Tjap nonna was a sweet condensed milk company that first entered Indonesia through the Nestle company. The company, however, draws upon baboe imagery in order to advertise their product. Baboes were nursemaids and childcare domestic servants for the Dutch empire, and therefore inherently associated with children. The work of the baboe became her identity, not being named or credited beyond their contributions to childcare within the empire. In order to sell a product geared towards children, employing baboe imagery ties the product to the care of children while also naturalizing baboes as domestic servants for Dutch families: in the way that baboes were the natural caretakers of Dutch children, Tjap Nonna was the natural choice for the enjoyment of the child. The brand relies heavily on orientalized depictions of the baboe to sell their product, using bright colors and traditional wear as a means of exoticizing the nursemaid in a manner that is common among several empires. \nMessage: Verso is in Indonesian.","analysis":"This postcard occupies a unique position in that it brands itself as a postcard, but also functions as an advertisement for a company in the way that a tradecard might.

John Valentine founded his printing and photography business in 1851, and his son expanded it. By the end of the 19th century, Valentine & Sons had expanded from Scotland to Great Britain, New Zealand, Jamaica, Morocco, in order to market images of popular tourist destinations from those regions. Valentine & Sons entered the picture postcard market in 1898 and continued to grow the business until the 1970 when they halted the production of postcards altogether. This postcard is signed by Lawson Wood, who worked as a painter and illustrator (of postcards and other media) from 1896 until the late 1940s.","description":"In the illustration of this postcard, a white female domestic servant—her status implied by her apron, white headpiece, and practical rather than elegant work shoes—rolls up her sleeves and brandishes a long, menacing hammer in one hand as she looks out of the room in which she stands quite erect. There, in the doorway, the presumed male children of the house—joined by a red-robed older man whom a viewer might assume is their father—trip over one another to leave the room before perhaps facing the wrath of the domestic and her formidable instrument of discipline. The one child’s face that is visible to the viewer betrays his horror as he looks back at the domestic, eyes wide, fists up in the air, and his mouth ajar as though mid-scream. Below the illustration, there is a few lines of text that reads “The Servant & How to Train Her - No. 6 ‘When her education is complete, she should be quite capable of taking affairs into her own hands & further instruction would be a mistake.’”\n\nAnalysis: This series was meant to prepare an employer with a set of frustrating mistakes to be made by their newly hired domestic servants, as well as how to contend with these issues. The sequenced cartoons are explained via the text at the bottom of the composition, as if directly addressing a hiring mistress with words of advice. The illustrations depict caricatures of young domestic workers in a way that the contemporary viewer would have found humorous. The postcard shown here is part of a complete six-piece series. \nThe domestic servant shown on this postcard is likely an Irish immigrant “Bridget,” as can be inferred by her orange hair. In this depiction, the domestic servant is masculinized despite the clothes she must wear, with muscles bulging and her promise of physical punishment to the males of the house in which she labors being sufficient enough to make them run from her presence. Immigrant domestic servants were often subjected to a loss of their feminine attributes within visual sources such as this postcard in order to hint at their better physical capabilities for working in the domestic industry compared to British women of reportedly more “delicate” constitutions, whereas this masculinization of female domestics also detracted from pervasive concerns that they would seduce male employers and cause disunity within the sacred domestic spheres they were able to penetrate. By depicting them as more “male,” an illustration like this one could diffuse any attraction that a viewer might feel toward one at all, so as not to compete with the assumed superior beauty of their mistresses. The humor of the postcard is to be found in the “Bridget” brandishing a hammer to dole out punishments to not only the male children of the house, but also the male employer, who is similarly trying to escape through the door to avoid her wrath as well. “Bridgets” and other non-white domestics functioned as disciplinarians for children while their parents were away, but it would seem ridiculous to the contemporary viewer for a domestic servant to police the behavior of and threaten physical discipline against her own employer, especially if male. \n\nMessage: This postcard was sent to a Miss P Hurcombe, courtesy of a Miss Braund at Devon House, Prospect Road in Prospect, Australia. The message reads, “Suppose you have a vacant space in your book, waiting for this, so will send it along. Hope you will soon fill the book. Love from A.J.”  This is the third exchange between Miss P Hurcombe and A.J. with the indication that the recipient has a book within which they are placing these postcards (See “The Servant and How to Train Her- No 2” and “The Servant (No. 3)…‘She will probably take some interest in the Tradespeople: this is only natural and should be encouraged.’”). This message indicates that the recipient was probably a collector of postcards, and perhaps she was attempting to complete her collection of this series in a scrapbook, as that was a common pastime of young women during the early 20th century.","analysis":"This series was meant to prepare an employer with a set of frustrating mistakes to be made by their newly hired domestic servants, as well as how to contend with these issues.

She is also wearing heeled, white boots and a large hat. She is holding a flower in her left hand and a cane in her right. The man over her shoulder is wearing a green long coat and a top hat. He is holding something in his hands, maybe another hat. The postcard is captioned “Birthday Greetings” at the top left corner. The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. This postcard is part of a series of birthday cards. \nAnalysis: The white-bordered birthday postcard from the early 1900s reproduces the eighteenth century European portraiture tradition of using an ornately attired black servant boy as a status symbol in white portraits. \nThe man’s dark skin allows the viewer to hypothesize that he is of African descent, however, his exact place of origin is deliberately left ambiguous. The purpose of including him in the postcard seems to be Oriental ornamentation. His presence and dark skin is used as a foil to highlight the lady’s immaculate whiteness, shyness, and femininity. Moreover, his placement in the postcard, behind the white girl, supports his ornamentation; he is not the main subject of the image, but the image and story would be incomplete without him. The postcard follows the long tradition of European portraiture that depicted black and brown “boys” serving white mistresses, while leaving their provenance unclear. This racialization and exoticization supports the values of New Imperialism, where Western nations expanded their empires into Africa and Asia, and as a result, had access to labor from those people. These values are so relevant that even though it was a Birthday Greetings postcard, the normalization of racialization and colonization is portrayed in a birthday card.  \nMessage: n/a","analysis":"The white-bordered birthday postcard from the early 1900s reproduces the eighteenth century European portraiture tradition of using an ornately attired black servant boy as a status symbol in white portraits. \nThe man’s dark skin allows the viewer to hypothesize that he is of African descent, however, his exact place of origin is deliberately left ambiguous.

A woman to the right presents a bowl to the dinner table; she has rosy cheeks and raised eyebrows signifying her embarrassment while the diners all sport a look of shock. Each guest is looking at the woman on the right, and the woman at the far left has red cheeks and a furrowed brow, signifying both her shock and her anger. The woman on the far right, who can be identified as a maidservant, is scantily dressed by early 20th century standards. Her black stockings are visible and her white underdress exposes her shoulders and chest. Compared with the dress of the other two women, the maidservant is practically in her underwear which causes her embarrassment, the guests’ shock, and the other woman’s anger. The contemporary viewer would have immediately understood the character on the far right to be an Irish maidservant, or a Bridget, based on her act of domestic servitude and her ignorance towards common English phrases. The text at the bottom of this postcard reads, \n“How Bridget served the salad undressed”\nTo serve the salad “undressed” would typically be understood as an instruction to leave the salad dressing on the side. However, this text highlights the Irish servant’s misinterpretation of her employer's instructions, which she took quite literally, serving the salad in her underwear. \n\nAnalysis: The “Irish Bridget” was a stereotype used to describe female domestic servants who immigrated to the US from Ireland between the 1840s and 1930s. This caricatured figure got its name from an important Irish catholic figure, Saint Brigid, which was also a popular name for girls in the mid-19th century. Irish maid servants were privately hired by the heads of households in urban American settings, with whom they typically lived throughout their time of employment as domestic workers. It was extremely common for middle-class white Americans in the urban east to hire an Irish servant as a means of displaying their social status and to assert the family’s position within the refinement of a growing middle class. One major way that a family’s respectability was assessed was based on their adherence to (Protestant) Christian morality. Irish immigrants, being primarily Catholic, were therefore automatically othered. In order to cast-out Irish immigrants, “Bridget” could be portrayed as unintelligent, lazy, ignorant, pretentious, promiscuous, defiant, demanding, and unaware of the parameters of her social status. In the image depicted above, the Irish servant is characterized as the unintelligent and ignorant “Bridget”. The idea of “refinement” was defined, in part, by positioning oneself in moral opposition to another group. Irish maidservants served as a scapegoat for this moral opposition, and thus the “Bridget” caricature was developed.","analysis":"The “Irish Bridget” was a stereotype used to describe female domestic servants who immigrated to the US from Ireland between the 1840s and 1930s.

This setting is likely staged. As the title (“An Ayah”) suggests, the woman is an ayah. Because the photograph has been hand-tinted, a process where an artist goes in to add color to a photograph after the fact, the colors that have been added are not necessarily the colors the ayah might have been wearing. Nonetheless, her patterned sari is purple, yellow, orange, and green with a white blouse underneath. Her hair is slicked back in the customary bun and she wears necklaces, bracelets, and toe rings. She looks just away from the photographer, not making eye contact. \nAnalysis: While it is painted, the postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on the homogenized ayah, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization. In other words, by refusing to give this woman her name and simply label her as “An Ayah,” this woman is a romanticized representation used by the West to identify all others who serve a similar role. The intention behind this colonial imagery was to show a constructed illusion of natives as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of the empire to the British public back home. The exoticization is highlighted through the hand-tinting after the fact: putting the ayah in colorful clothing showcases the presumed Oriental affinity for color. The ayah’s passivity is emphasized in her inability to look directly at the viewer and her sitting posture. There is also an intention to desexualize this figure: with increasing anxiety in Britain about white purity and miscegenation, the intimate relationship the ayah had within the home became a sore point for the empire. Thus, the photograph’s setting within the home serves both to contextualize the ayah in her domestic role, but also desexualize her placement within the imperial home. Thus, the ayah was depicted as intentionally plain, so as to negate any suspicions of impropriety and erase the long history of sexual exploitation within Indian domestic service. \nMessage: None.","analysis":"While it is painted, the postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on the homogenized ayah, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization.

Despite her lower socioeconomic status in relation to her employers, however, the dress under her apron is polka dotted and has a ribbon at the back, and her footwear also appears unusually attractive or luxurious. Her face is void of wrinkles as she closes her eyes and smiles, while a man who one may presume is her male employer holds a finger endearingly up to her chin. The man has gray hair, signifying his older age, and is adorned with a bow tie and overcoat as if to indicate his higher-class status in relation to the maidservant. In the back of the room, a door opens slightly and reveals a stern-faced woman looking at the questionable scene unfolding between the maid and her employer. This woman appear significantly less attractive by traditional standards than the youthful maidservant. In the top right corner of the postcard, the picture is complemented by with the words “How to Kiss the Housemaid” appear.\n\nAnalysis: This postcard depicts a male employer clearly violating the personal space of a domestic servant as she attempts to go about her household duties. His gesture holds clear sexual undertones, capitalizing on the pervasive fear among mistresses that their employed domestic servants would be regarded as more beautiful and desirable than themselves, essentially luring away their husbands with their youthful, purported seductive natures. Given that the female domestic also leans into her male employer’s touch, closes her eyes and smiles, this depiction of the laborer also preys upon societal fears around the time of the postcard’s production that such domestics would shatter the marital unity and Protestant values that underpinned the supposed superior virtue and sanctity of higher-class British households. White female domestic servants were often viewed as willful seductresses when interacting with their employers, and Irish “Bridgets”—whom the domestic featured in this postcard may represent given her stereotypical hair color—were especially targets of such demeaning British anxieties. The domestic is also shirking the responsibilities of her occupation in apparently consenting to this interaction with her employer, and in this way, this postcard also propounds the commonly held notions of such domestics being lazy and negligent with their work. Of course, while the illustration might generate an outcry among viewers today for its underlying theme of sexual harassment by male employers that was in fact a common threat for domestic servants such as the woman portrayed, it is clear that this postcard was intended to produce more of a comedic effect among its contemporary audience since the affections of the male employer seem to be reciprocated. Through this intentional choice, the white working-class maidservant is depicted as complicit in this sexual impropriety rather than a victim who would have likely faced mental distress in reality from an employer’s usually unwanted advances.\n\n\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Is this the way you do, I hope you always mind there’s no one watching[.] mind & not spill the coffee. Weary Willie.” The address appears to contain the following: “Miss Eggalstone, ℅ Mrs. Wright, St. James Rd, Ilkley.” This message clearly relates back to the sexualized behaviors of the female domestic servant on the front of the postcard, indicating that perhaps the intended recipient of this ephemera works in a similar occupation. The writer appears to be playfully teasing the recipient with the implication that the domestic might be engaged in a romantic and/or sexual liaison with her male employer. This could, of course, be more of a degrading hint of the postcard recipient’s supposed sexual deviancy or impropriety.","analysis":"This postcard depicts a male employer clearly violating the personal space of a domestic servant as she attempts to go about her household duties.

This could, of course, be more of a degrading hint of the postcard recipient’s supposed sexual deviancy or impropriety.","__v":0,"imageLinks":[{"_id":"6712ef53d7f22713ec58c0e6","link":"/images/postcards/321B.jpg","cardNumber":321,"name":"321B","orientation":1,"size":{"width":1128,"height":1682}},{"_id":"6712ef56d7f22713ec58c5fc","link":"/images/postcards/321A.jpg","cardNumber":321,"name":"321A","orientation":1,"size":{"width":1121,"height":1718}}],"originalLocation":{"latitude":54.3151594,"longitude":-1.9181532111487878,"_id":"67ccb20c6c89aaaae23d415b"},"destinationLocation":{"latitude":53.9257254,"longitude":-1.824441,"_id":"67ccb20c6c89aaaae23d415c"},"postLocation":{"latitude":54.3151594,"longitude":-1.9181532111487878,"_id":"67ccb20c6c89aaaae23d415d"},"isBlurByDefault":false,"isInScrapbook":false,"themes":["Sexual Impropriety","Uk","Working-class White Maidservants","Irish Bridget Stereotype","Sexualization","Lazy/stupid Stereotype"]},{"_id":"6705807b1d3345f198753bef","number":210,"item":"postcard","date":"Post 1902","postmarked":"No","place":"n/a","company":"n/a","companyInformation":"n/a","description":"Two Indian men are dressed in long sleeve shirts, rolled up pants, and a loin cloth. Both men are wearing head coverings and barefoot. One of the men is standing looking directly at the photographer while the other is bending over to sweep contents into a woven basket. They are both holding sweepers in their right hands, and the man bent over the work is also carrying a woven basket in his left hand. The background of the image shows the men outside sweeping what may be a deck. On that deck, there is also a potted plant and a table with a vase on top. The men are in front of a structure, which can be assumed as a house. The postcard contains the caption “Our Servants. Mehters. (Sweepers).” The image is vertical making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subjects depicted are Indian sweepers called Mehtars (Mehters). We do not know if the men photographed actually worked as domestic servants in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what Indian men-servants look like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of an Indian manservant would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nAccording to European gender roles, the Indian servants are performing feminine tasks, and by ethnographically representing Indian men in this manner, the British audience is inclined to assume they, and thus all Indian men, are effeminate.  \nMehtars, or sweepers, were recruited from dalit, the “untouchable” caste in Indian society, and their labor was stigmatized. \nThis postcard is part of a set of postcards illustrating different types of men-servants in British imperial India.

The speaker of the postcard’s caption - “Poor old John” - is unclear; it may be the postcard’s reader, or it may be the Black woman. The Black woman is wearing a red skirt, a white blouse, black slippers, a knotted red headdress, and gold hoop earrings. The young man is wearing a light green shirt, blue pants with black stripes, and no shoes. Both figures have caricatured facial features: namely, their thick, bright red lips. The young Black man is doing something with a wooden box in his lap - what this task is, however, is unclear. The background scenery is bare, with the only discernible detail being the faint outline of a door. The verso of the postcard has the word “postcard” written in various languages: English, French, German, Russian, and others. \n\nAnalysis: The first, most immediately recognizable feature of this postcard is the presence of the caricatured red lips - a detail common on caricatures of Black people. This detail (along with the Black woman’s earrings and knotted headdress) is meant to racialize them as “exotic,” and an “other.” The two are wearing modest clothing, which is meant to be indicative of their relatively low position on the socio-economic ladder. The Black woman has a pronounced bossom, though they are not accentuated for the purpose of sexualizing her; they are meant to paint her as a maternal, entirely desexualized individual. Whether we interpret the caption of the postcard as being said by the woman or by the observer, it can be concluded that the underlying narrative of this postcard is that the Black woman is being rude, cruel, and bossy toward her family - a stereotype common in caricatures of the Mammy. The various languages on the verso of the card suggests that this card was being marketed to a large, global audience. The global proliferation of these postcards and their associated narratives of race, gender, and class play a role in a dialectic between various cultures’ ideas of these social distinctions. \n\nMessage: Although the postcard is not stamped or postmarked and does not have a message written on it, there is an address written on it.

A man, dressed in a tuxedo leans in to kiss the cheek of the woman in a white dress. She stands there, seemingly complicit, while the woman to the right is visible through the cracked door. She appears to be oblivious to the scene taking place in the nursery. Meanwhile, a child witnesses the stolen kiss, looking upon the action with wide eyes. The child’s eyes point downwards, leading the viewer’s gaze towards the subtitle, “The Stolen Nursey Kiss”, queuing the viewer into the setting. The man’s stance, stradling between the two women with one hand on the doorknob and the other on his mistress, conveys the swiftness of his action and the illicit nature of his intentions. The woman behind the door appears to be backing into the room, leaving the man little time to linger with his mistress. \n\nAnalysis: The woman in white can be identified as an Irish domestic servant who is likely being criticized for her alluring presence. In the 1880’s, Irish women began to be criticized for dressing in a manner that made them indistinguishable from their middle-class female employers. Thus, they were dressing in alignment with the contemporary beauty standards, which raised tensions among middle-class women and their husbands. In this image, the Irish servant is dressed in pure white with a red necktie and belt. Her facial features are dainty and her waist is impossibly small, making her attractive to the male gaze. In addition, doors are a commonly used in portrayals of Irish servants’ sexual impropriety, as they signify the demarcation of private space. Within the context of one’s home, doors symbolize the precarious position that domestic servants held as being not quite family, but also not quite outside the family, making any sexual encounter they had with another member of the household scandalous. Although the man in this scene is the one initiating the illicit kiss, the Irish servant is the one being criticized. By holding the doorknob while leaning over to give his mistress a kiss, the man in this postcard is crossing the threshold between two worlds: his home life and his professional affairs. This postcard ultimately represents the tension between married couples who housed female domestic servants. \n\nSent to: “Miss Mayme Goodbread (?), Live Oak, Florida”\n Message: “Why my dear girl, why didn’t you send me a card.

Her servant status is denoted by her white apron and matching bonnet as well as the serving tray she carries, while the balding older man behind her is presumably her male employer, who is clearly partaking in a questionable act as he places one hand on his maid’s shoulder while the other caresses her chin. The maid does not seem visibly perturbed by her employer’s advances, and if anything, her cheeks are rosy and she closes her eyes with a complicit smile on her face. In the background, a stout woman dressed in a frilly yet austere dress curls her hands into fists before her chest as she gazes upon the scene before her from the doorway with flushed red cheeks, unnoticed by the maid and her male employer. Her appearance reveals a mixture of both shock and fury, hinting that she is the mistress of the house. The text confirms this reading, written from the perspective of the mistress: “Will I? Ever again have my husband hire the maid -- Nix!”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard depicts a male employer clearly violating the personal space of a domestic servant as she attempts to go about her household duties. His gesture holds clear sexual undertones, capitalizing on the pervasive fear among mistresses that their employed domestic servants would be regarded as more beautiful and desirable than themselves, essentially luring away their husbands with their youthful, purported seductive natures. This depiction of the laborer also preys upon societal fears around the time of the postcard’s production that such domestics would shatter the marital unity and Protestant values that underpinned the supposed superior virtue and sanctity of higher-class British households. White female domestic servants were often viewed as willful seductresses when interacting with their employers, and Irish “Bridgets”—whom the domestic featured in this postcard may represent given her stereotypical hair color—were especially targets of such demeaning anxieties. Given that the female domestic is blushing furiously, nearly closing her eyes and smiling, this illustration may aim to legitimize such stereotypes. The domestic is also shirking the responsibilities of her occupation in apparently consenting to this interaction with her employer, and in this way, this postcard also propounds the commonly held notions of such domestics being lazy and negligent with their work. Of course, while the illustration might generate an outcry among viewers today for its underlying theme of sexual harassment by male employers that was in fact a common threat for domestic servants such as the woman portrayed, it is clear that this postcard was intended to produce more of a comedic effect among its contemporary audience since the affections of the male employer seem to be reciprocated. Through this intentional choice, the white working-class maidservant is depicted as complicit in this sexual impropriety rather than a victim who would have likely faced mental distress in reality from an employer’s usually unwanted advances. Finally, the text that accompanies the drawing perhaps relates to the “servant problem” that North American and British employers bemoaned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which can be defined as their perceived lack of competent--or in this case non-threatening--domestics to hire. In the maidservant shown clearly posing a threat to the desirability and thence authority of her mistress, it seems as though part of the servant problem may also be the alleged untrustworthiness and promiscuity of the current domestics employed. When the mistress announces in the text that she will never again let her husband select their maid, the implication is that the current white, working-class female domestics that were proliferant in their society at the time were too problematic to continue using. Those who made such arguments sometimes became proponents for hiring black female domestics, who were largely perceived as less feminine, older, and as racial inferiors, thereby making them less threats to the allure of the mistress in comparison. \n\nMessage: The verso includes the following personal message: “Dear (?)

The top section is an image. Located in a basement of some sort, white women and children huddle amongst one another. They clutch at each other in fear and nervous anticipation as the central figure stares up in bravery, suggesting Christian faith with a book in her left hand, likely a bible. The top left is the source of anxiety for these women and children: a group of men are storming the basement location. The men are clearly armed and wear soldier attire. Out of the women and children in fear, the ayah is the only figure who is looking at the incoming attack. She is located on the right of the image. She wears Orientalized attire that is most stereotypically attributed to the Middle East, rather than India, with big hoop earrings and a veil over her hair. The bottom half of the postcard is text, more specifically, it is a ballad called “Jessie’s Dream at Lucknow” that was written by the wife of a British commander during the Siege of Lucknow in 1857, a battle in the larger war of the Sepoy Rebellion. \nAnalysis: The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 was a revolt against British colonialism led by Indian soldiers (called sepoys). The tactics by sepoys consisted of storming British fortresses and attacking such locations for political advantage, but it was white women who got stuck in this crossfire. As such, the siege is blown up in the British imagination as evidence of Indian cruelty, especially against innocent women and children. Depictions, like this image, emphasized the whiteness of the victims and the extraordinary aggressiveness of sepoys by locating the figures in compromising locations, setting the event right before attack, or creating caricatures of sepoys. The fear of the women in the image solidifies the negative perception of sepoys in Britain as perpetrators of violence against innocent victims. The ayah’s glance over at sepoys before the other women almost serves to position her as the warning signal for the group about the incoming danger. The ayah in this particular context fulfills the role of the loyal servant: as her own people are revolting against the awful conditions instigated by her employers, she chooses to remain by the British side as the ever loyal and affectionate ayah.\nMessage: None","analysis":"The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 was a revolt against British colonialism led by Indian soldiers (called sepoys).

She peers through the keyhole on the door and her expression is one of shock. A man stands behind her wearing a red robe and a towel around his neck. He gazes at the servant’s backside and raises his hand with a look of equal shock. The caption at the bottom of this composition says, “My word! if I catch you bending.” \n\nAnalysis: Based on this postcard’s caption, the viewer is meant to infer that the domestic servant is eaves-dropping or spying on activities in her employer’s bathroom. During the early 20th century, jokes about a female servant’s proximity to the intimate spaces of their employers were circulated. This was seen as a scandalous consequence of hiring live-in servants, but it also functioned as a source of humor for the artist’s contemporaries. In addition, the presence of the man with a raised arm indicates that he is about to spank the domestic servant because she was caught bending over. The man’s dialogue insinuates that her bending over is an automatic invitation to spank her behind. Sexual assault was a common source of anxiety among female domestic servants, as unwelcome (and sometimes violent) advancements were often made by their male employers. This postcard uses this traumatic occurrence as a way to make fun of female servants, in an attempt to make the viewer laugh. \n\nThis postcard does not have a postage stamp, so it is unclear whether or not it was mailed to the recipient. However, there is a message on the verso which indicates that the postcard was exchanged in some fashion. The message reads, “(Well it time to take my bath [sic]) now so cant write much but must go to work. Will write more next time. hoping (sic) you are all well[.] Good bye, Ernest”. The writer’s comment about taking a bath is likely a reference to the subject of this postcard’s illustration. This impertinent remark shows that both the writer and the recipient would have found the image to be humorous.","analysis":"Based on this postcard’s caption, the viewer is meant to infer that the domestic servant is eaves-dropping or spying on activities in her employer’s bathroom.

The words “Servant’s Insurance Act” can be seen at the top right of the postcard as well, underscored as though suggesting its significance to the illustration. Her status as a maid is indicated by her black dress with white trim and a white half-apron, with a ruffled headpiece atop her curly orange hair. She elevates one of her feet, which is crudely bandaged. On the small bedside table that features in the postcard, there are three items atop a tray with the following labels, from left to right: “Bovril,” “Cream,” and “Wine.” At the bottom of the postcard, the text seems to clarify the maid’s situation, and reads: “I burnt my small toe and I don’t mean to work till it is quite better, I prefer to have a burnt toe.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these, even if made somewhat humorous in the postcard present, raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be used as a “beef tea” of sorts and could explain why cream is present on the table as well. One potentially humorous reading of these items is that the “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, as a popular stereotype about “Bridgets” at the time was that they often stole their employers’ food as their own and would even invite unwelcome guests into the house they served to indulge in the supplies.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard has a very short personal message, reading “See you soon. Florence” when translated from French. The address is somewhat illegible, although it is apparent that the intended recipient of this postcard lives in Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives, Calvados in France.","analysis":"This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act.

He is wearing a white shirt under blue overalls and working boots. He has white hair and a white mustache. His hands are resting on his knees and he looks away from the camera, not engaging the viewer. The background is some sort of building, maybe a barn. The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The image contains a caption titled “D515:-OLD BLACK JOE.” The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. \nAnalysis: This postcard shows the stereotype of ‘Tom’ who is a faithful, submissive, and happy enslaved man. The Tom stereotype was introduced in the Antebellum period as a defense to slavery as he represents a reliable, happy Christian server. He is gentle. He tends to be old and reliant on white’s approval. The term “Uncle Tom” is still used as a derogatory reference for a black man seen as excessively subservient to white people, and an appeaser and apologist for white supremacy and racism.\nThe postcard published in the early 1900s shows American lingering nostalgia for slavery and Southern life. Being published nearly 50 years post-emancipation, the postcard creators had discretion over the slave narrative. Therefore sparking the question for proponents of slavery: how could slavery be wrong if black servants, males (Tom caricatures) and females (Mammy carictures) were contented and loyal? This eradicates white American and European responsibility and guilt over slavery.\nThe caption “Old Black Joe” refers to a song by Stephen C. Foster. Written in 1860, “Old Black Joe” is a parlor song about a fictional servant that was inspired by a servant in Foster’s father-in-law’s home. It is considered a plantation song because of its sound, however, it is written in proper English, not dialect like other plantation songs.

Titled, “‘Mammy’ The Patron Saint Dixie,” the postcard depicts an older Black woman slumped over in a wheelchair. She is wearing a red shawl, a blue blanket, and a white headdress. Notably, a gold halo hovers over her head. The woman appears ill and tired, by her facial expression. She is resting outside on a porch under the shade of a canopy. \n\nAnalysis: Although this image is taken from John Charles McNeil’s book of poetry, the postcard appears to have an almost anthropological air to it. The caption denotes the woman as a Mammy, and even suggests that the Mammy is an integral figure of the South. In this way, the postcard sentimentalized the Mammy figure: erasing her agency and the atrocities of American slavery. The halo and saintly representation of the Mammy figure conflicts with the truth of the treatment of Black people in the United States. The Black woman is racialized in her white headdress: Black woman are often given headdresses as a way of symbolizing their “exotic,” and “otherized” heritage. Although her labor is unclear by her attire, it can be assumed that she worked as a domestic servant because of her designation as a Mammy. \n\nMessage: This postcard was sent from North Carolina to Woodford, Maine.

The white woman is hugging the older Black woman from the side with both of her hands, looking directly at the observer. The older Black woman is wearing a white headdress, a brown blouse with a white kerchief, and a long blue skirt; her expression is somber and longing. The younger white woman is wearing a styled white blouse and a flowing brown skirt; the woman is not smiling, but she nonetheless looks content. The house they are both sitting in front of is painted in bright colors. It has a wide staircase and porch, and appears to belong to an affluent family. The title of the postcard, which lies beneath the image, reads, “The South - That is No More.” \n\nAnalysis: This postcard suggests nothing humorous in its art style, or caricatured depictions.

The postcard follows the long tradition of European portraiture that depicted black and brown “boys” serving white mistresses, while leaving their provenance unclear. This racialization and exoticization supports the values of New Imperialism, where Western nations expanded their empires into Africa and Asia, and as a result, had access to labor from those people. These values are so relevant that even though it was a Valentine’s Day postcard with a Valentine’s Day poem, in the illustration love itself is commoditized and racialized in the spirit of New Imperialism.  \nMessage: Even though it is not postmarked and there is no message, it can be assumed that postcards, such as these, were perhaps exchanged between young, middle-class, white lovers as part of courtship. The racialized depiction of the black Orientalized “boys” would have perhaps been considered “cute” and flattering to the recipient, enabling the collector, sender, and recipient to collectively partake in imperialism through a simple everyday object like a Valentine’s Day card.","analysis":"The postcard depicts two racialized men carrying a white female mistress.

The woman is holding the child in her left hand, and is standing in front of a porch. She is wearing a white bonnet, a maid’s blouse with a white collar, and a white apron. The child is wearing a white gown and is holding a teething toy in one hand and an indiscernible item in the other. The woman is looking at the face of the child with a happy (almost proud) expression. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard does not indicate through its imagery in any way that it is meant to be taken as humorous; instead, the postcard is meant to depict a loving relationship between a Black domestic worker and the white baby she cares for. This seemingly loving postcard, however, is meant to perpetuate the narrative that Black women enjoy their labor, and in fact prefer white children over their own Black children. It should also be noted that even though this postcard is a photograph image, photographs can be staged and altered in ways that amplify certain narratives and quiet others. In this case, the photographer likely set up and staged this image to suggest that the child’s caretaker bears a significant affection and pride toward the child. In reality, however, the woman in the photograph likely loathes her work as a domestic laborer; her displays of affection toward the child are meant to appease her employer.

This seemingly loving postcard, however, is meant to perpetuate the narrative that Black women enjoy their labor, and in fact prefer white children over their own Black children. It should also be noted that even though this postcard is a photograph image, photographs can be staged and altered in ways that amplify certain narratives and quiet others. In this case, the photographer likely set up and staged this image to suggest that the child’s caretaker bears a significant affection and pride toward the child. In reality, however, the woman in the photograph likely loathes her work as a domestic laborer; her displays of affection toward the child are meant to appease her employer.

John Valentine founded his printing and photography business in 1851, and his son expanded it. By the end of the 19th century, Valentine & Sons had expanded from Scotland to Great Britain, New Zealand, Jamaica, Morocco, in order to market images of popular tourist destinations from those regions. Valentine & Sons entered the picture postcard market in 1898 and continued to grow the business until the 1970 when they halted the production of postcards altogether. This postcard is signed by Lawson Wood, who worked as a painter and illustrator (of postcards and other media) from 1896 until the late 1940s.","description":"In this illustration a young girl in a pink dress, white apron and cap is falling backwards on a table full of dishes which topples to the floor and breaks. The tail and hind leg of a black cat also pokes out from the wreckage. Sparks and smoke radiate from the left side of this composition while a skillet that once held sausages and a teapot fly towards the girl. Diagonal red lines emphasize their movement and trajectory. At the bottom of the illustration, a block of text reads “The Servant and How to Train Her- No. 2 ‘Leave her to do things by herself, and a gas stove will save a lot of anxiety and expense.’” \n\nAnalysis: This series was meant to prepare an employer with a set of frustrating mistakes to be made by their newly hired domestic servants, as well as how to contend with these issues. The sequenced cartoons are explained via the text at the bottom of the composition, as if directly addressing a hiring mistress with words of advice. The illustrations depict caricatures of young domestic workers in a way that the contemporary viewer would have found humorous. The postcard shown here is part of a complete six-piece series. The second illustration of the series shows an incident in which the servant, due to her ditziness, has caused her employer’s stove to explode. In the 19th century, coal was a common source of fuel for heating and cooking, but coal appliances required constant replenishing and ran the risk of overheating and exploding if they were not properly maintained. The caption on this image suggests that the employer invest in a gas stove to “save a lot of anxiety and expense”, as the illustrated servant is assumed to be incompetent in completing tasks unsupervised which could lead to disasters. Gas stoves could be left on for hours at a time with less consequence, and they were introduced to the kitchen appliance market as early as the 1860s in England, and they became commonplace by the 20th century.\n \nThis postcard was sent to a Miss P Hurcombe, courtesy of a Miss Braund at Devon House, Prospect Road in Prospect, Australia.

The recipient may also feel that they can relate to the message of this card based on their own experience with a live-in servant.

The figure is holding tools of his trade in his left hand with a sword and shield on his belt. His right hand is raised with the palm upwards. He has a lock in his mouth. He is looking away without engaging the viewer. He is standing outside with a pathway, houses, and greenery in the background. There is a crest in the upper left corner. The postcard contains the caption “The Trusty Servant, Winchester.” The postcard also contains text: “A trusty servant’s portrait would you see, This emblematic figure well survey. The porker’s snout--not nice in dirt shows; The padlock shut--no secrets he’ll disclose; Patient the ass--his master’s wrath to bear Swiftness in errand--the stag’s feet declare, Loaded his left hand--apt to labour saith The vest, his neatness; open hand, his faith; Girt with his sword--his shield upon his arm; Himself and mater he’ll protect from harm.” The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. \nAnalysis: This postcard depicts “The Trusty Servant” image which dates back to the late sixteenth century. Created at Winchester College, it illustrates the ideal servant for masters and mistresses and the corresponding poem lists all the qualities necessary to be “The Trusty Servant.” It suggests both the difficulty of achieving all those qualities and the dehumanization necessary to be subjected to them. “The Trusty Servant” is loyal as the lock in his mouth visualizes and the poem explains: “The padlock shut--no secrets he’ll disclose.” He is clean and civilized. This is seen through his European-style, neat clothing, and the lines “The vest, his neatness.” He is Christian as seen with his open palm and “open hand, his faith.” He is protective: his sword and shield show along with “Girt with his sword--his shield upon his arm; Himself and mater he’ll protect from harm.” He sets a standard as he represents everything a European household looks for in a servant.\nThe reproduction of medieval imagery in the era of postcards highlights the continuation of the belief systems set prior to New Imperialism. In the late nineteenth, early twentieth century, New Imperialism enabled U.S. and European empires access to service from people throughout Asia and Africa and the ideals of a servant sustained through this expansion.\nMessage: n/a","analysis":"This postcard depicts “The Trusty Servant” image which dates back to the late sixteenth century.

The image features two Indian women in black and white photograph. The setting seems to be outdoors, but is likely staged. The woman on the left is standing in front of a wooden fence enclosing greenery behind it. She looks just away from the viewer and is wearing her hair tied back with a dark sari. The veil is pulled over her head in a show of modesty. Her arms and neck are adorned with jewelry. The other woman also looks away from the viewer with a similar placid expression. She wears a white sari, similar jewelry, and a striped blouse. Her veil, in a show of modesty, also is pulled over her hair in the traditional Indian fashion. The message is very unusually placed on the front of the postcard, likely due to postcards not offering space to write a message on the back at this point in time.\nAnalysis: This postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on two figures, homogenized under whatever text label is at the bottom, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization. In labeling these women “Hindu Ayahs” without a name, they are denied their identity and forced to embody a white construction of the Indian race. The intention behind this colonial imagery was to show a constructed illusion of natives as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of the empire to the British public back home. The ayahs’ passivity is emphasized in their inability to look directly at the viewer. There is also an intention to desexualize this figure: with increasing anxiety in Britain about white purity and miscegenation, the intimate relationship the ayah had within the home became a sore point for the empire. Thus, the ayah was depicted as intentionally plain, so as to negate any suspicions of impropriety and erase the long history of sexual exploitation within Indian domestic service.\nMessage: The message by the sender is only half of the original, as the sender must have utilized multiple postcards to showcase their thoughts. Nonetheless, the text reads: “...the parcel I sent yesterday, I sent it off just before I left home in the morning. What do you think of them? Rather gaudy, aren’t they? But you need not mind that, they are real Indian work, & probably made by a woman, sitting by the bedside of a plague stricken person waiting for them to slip their cable. These two girls on this card are ‘ayahs’ or native nurses. People have them to look after their children, some of the ayahs a very good looking and others are mighty ugly, this is not a good sample at all for they are neither one or the other.” The sender details native characters to a loved one back home in London, sharing their experience in order to allow the receiver a glimpse into colonial life in India. It is obvious the disdain with which the sender observes Indian life.","analysis":"This postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on two figures, homogenized under whatever text label is at the bottom, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization.

The background is plain and undefined, drawing the viewer’s full attention to the servant herself and highlighting the text surrounding her. The text at the top of the postcard reads, “Domestic Servants’ Insurance Act”. Its subtext reads, “The Sweep gave me a black eye, and I am going to lie up for a month, I am insured!” On her apron is a black handprint, possibly from ashes in the chimney. \n\nAnalysis: The illustrator of this postcard suggests that female domestic servants were pleased with the benefits offered by Servant’s Insurance Act, and that they used these novel legal protections to shirk their working responsibilities. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers who made less than £160 per year were entitled to mandatory paid medical leave for up to 26 weeks. Sometimes they were also eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Predictably, this requirement was a source of outrage for employers who were responsible for the payments. One can also infer that the postcard’s illustrator intended to criticize Irish immigrant domestic workers, which were pejoratively referred to as “Bridgets”. (See “Bridget'' tag on the Explore page for more information.) Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular postcard, the illustration insinuates that the domestic worker was not only lazy for faking an injury to avoid work, but she is also depicted as being unintelligent. The text mentions a chimney sweep as the cause of her injury, and the handprint on her apron insinuates that she rubbed charcoal on her eyelid to fake a black eye while the charcoal handprint serves as evidence of her stupidity and obliviousness. While this postcard might be an attempt to satirize the Servant’s Insurance act, the fight for worker’s rights came from outrage against unfair treatments. The mistreatment of domestic servants included: long and demanding working hours which lacked boundaries between work and leisure, poor living conditions which were often cramped, cold, or unclean, social isolation, and miniscule wages that were often withheld for months at a time. Irish immigrant workers were known for asserting themselves and defying their employers in order to meet their needs, which was another source of criticism and satire.\n\nThis postcard was sent to a Mr. E.

Thus, the ayah was depicted as intentionally plain and with their veils over their hair, so as to negate any suspicions of impropriety and erase the long history of sexual exploitation within Indian domestic service. \nMessage: None.","message":"None.","__v":0,"imageLinks":[{"_id":"67081af767fa9da418a0038a","name":"121A","link":"/images/postcards/121A.jpg","size":{"width":1121,"height":1708},"orientation":1,"cardNumber":121},{"_id":"67081af767fa9da418a0038b","name":"121B","link":"/images/postcards/121B.jpg","size":{"width":1105,"height":1749},"orientation":1,"cardNumber":121}],"originalLocation":{"latitude":44.933143,"longitude":7.540121,"_id":"67ccb20c6c89aaaae23d416d"},"isBlurByDefault":false,"isInScrapbook":false,"themes":["South Asia","Anthropological/ethnographic","Orientalization","Indian Ayah","Hand Tinted","British Empire","Desexualization"]},{"_id":"6705807e1d3345f198753c1f","number":221,"item":"postcard","date":"Post 1902","postmarked":"No","place":"Madeira, Portugal","company":"n/a","companyInformation":"n/a","description":"This photographic postcard shows two men with dark skin, wearing dress clothes carrying a white woman in a hammock-like carriage.

What exactly the Black woman is teaching the other three is unclear, though the presence of cooking utensils may indicate that the lesson is on some culinary discipline. The Black woman is dressed in a modest blue dress, a white apron, a pair of wire glasses, and a red and yellow headdress. The three white women are wearing brightly-colored, high-end dresses and stylish hats; they also have sun umbrellas with them. The Black woman is sitting in a modest chair, and one of the young white women is seated in a cushioned chair - the other two younger women are sitting/standing. Behind the four is a fireplace lit beneath a cooking pot; the room they are in is adorned with ragged rugs, and modest appliances. The postcard is captioned, “The Love Drop.”\n\nAnalysis: The older Black woman is likely a servant woman, or a Mammy. Her apron actions are indicative of her labor as a domestic servant. The Black woman’s bright headdress is meant to be evocative of her heritage as an “otherized,” “exotic” figure. The three white women are likely the Black woman’s employer family. Their bright, fancy attire is in stark contrast with the modest attire of the Black Mammy; this is meant to be suggestive of their vastly different standings on the socio-economic - as well as racial - hierarchies. The Mammy is sitting on an uncushioned wooden chair, while one of the younger white women is seated on a more comfortable seat. This detail represents their difference in quality and convenience of life. This postcard suggests that the young women have something valuable to learn from the Black woman, since the Black woman is teaching them a presumably useful skill; playing into the narrative that the Mammy figure is competent in her abilities. Interestingly, this narrative seemingly goes against the general assertion that Black people have a lot to learn from their white employers: civility, the finer aspects of high-status life. Although this postcard does not contradict this narrative, seeing a Black person teach anything to a white person is rare in this kind of imagery. The postcard also serves to sentimentalize the relationship between the Black woman and her white employers - conveying a profound sense of love and mutual admiration.","analysis":"The older Black woman is likely a servant woman, or a Mammy.

Her hooked nose is exaggerated and enlarged, which draws the viewer’s attention towards her face. The corners of her mouth are downturned and her eyes are wide, suggesting surprise or confusion. Her image is partially reflected in the mirrored part of the mantle which is surrounded by modestly elegant woodwork. The caption at the bottom of the composition reads, “We’ve got a Jew-’ell of a servant”. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard features a derogatory caricature of a Jewish domestic servant, as indicated by the emphasis on her hooked nose and the pun, “Jew-’ell”, which serves to highlight her ethnic and/or religious identity. Since these postcards are most likely hand-tinted photographs, a process in which pigment was added to a black and white print after production, the woman’s facial features would have also been exaggerated during that process. However, since photography was still a relatively new medium, it had the potential to convince the viewer that any photograph was a direct representation of reality even when photographs were intentionally manipulated to support the artist’s intended message; this phenomenon is known as the myth of photographic indexicality in studies on semiotics. In the case of this Bamforth postcard, the artist intended to communicate an anti-semetic message about Jewish women who performed domestic labor, most likely for a Protestant Christian family.\n\nThis postcard was mailed to a Mrs Alice Ridwell in Centerville, R # 92 Pennsylvania in the year of 1912.

Her position of servitude is denoted by her white bonnet, frilly white apron, and collared blouse typical of a domestic. She looks behind her with a slight smile and rosy cheeks as a man--whom a viewer can assume to be her employer through his formal overcoat and tie--places a hand around her lower hip from behind and kisses her on the cheek that is turned toward him. In the background, unnoticed by the maid and her male employer, is the seeming mistress of the house. Her mouth is opened wide in shock as she beholds the scene, her visible arm suspended mid-air with a bend at the elbows and her palm face-down to further betray her surprise. Interestingly, both the male employer and his wife appear to be significantly older than the domestic, both with white hair and pudgy, wrinkled faces. In contrast, the domestic has blonde or rusty hair and seems markedly younger and more conventionally attractive. On the bottom left corner of the postcard, the words “Close contact” are printed along with a personal message from the postcard buyer which adds “with Kitty.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard seeks to convey the sexual impropriety of white working-class domestic servants who mistresses sometimes hesitated to employ out of fears that their husbands would find these often young laborers more attractive and fall for their seductive charms. Rather than making this an illustration of unwanted sexual harassment on part of the employer, this appears to be a clandestine romance that the domestic servant willingly engages in and perhaps even initiates to the same extent as her employer. Since the home was also viewed as a microcosm of empire during the Age of New Imperialism, moreover, it is possible that this postcard is also warning viewers that working-class domestic servants--many of whom were employed as immigrants from European countries and were hard to differentiate in terms of skin complexion and presumed “race” from their employers--would pose a threat to the harmony of the empires they “invaded” just like the hallowed domestic spheres and the marital unions that underpinned them. This reading is further reinforced in this particular postcard by the fact that the domestic servant featured may be an Irish “Bridget” based on her hair color, immigrant laborers who found themselves especially subjected to cruel stereotypes insisting that they were sexual deviants who tried to seduce their employers and showed general defiance toward those they served. Most likely, a contemporary viewer would have found this postcard humorous simply for the shock value inherent in the scene and the facial expression of the mistress in the background. What is perhaps most intriguing about this illustration when coupled with the text, however, is that the postcard’s sender was likely accusing the intended recipient of conducting an improper affair with his own domestic servant. \n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard contains the following message from the sender: “This is how you better half [sic] looked the first time you smaked [sic] Kitty. Regards (?).” The address is hard to decipher, although it is clear that the letter’s recipient was located in San Francisco, California in the United States. This message relates back to the illustration on the other side, hinting that the sender is accusing the intended recipient of making sexual advances toward his domestic servant. It is unclear who sent the postcard, but the information available suggests that the recipient is either being called out spitefully for such alleged behavior by perhaps his wife or is the subject of a light-hearted yet suggestive joke by a friend who is almost praising him for his ability to sexually prey upon his domestic servant.","analysis":"This postcard seeks to convey the sexual impropriety of white working-class domestic servants who mistresses sometimes hesitated to employ out of fears that their husbands would find these often young laborers more attractive and fall for their seductive charms.

The black and white rendering takes place on some kind of a platform: the white child stands on a raised platform and grips a railing located at the end of it. The young child, presumably a little boy, faces away from the viewer. From what we can see, he wears a black dress with a white square border around the neck and white lace details on the end of the sleeves. He also wears a hat, underneath which his light hair peeks out. The outfit is reminiscent of a sailor’s costume. Behind him, in a protective position, stands a native Indian woman. Her face is more visible, seen in profile, as she looks at the same thing her ward is. Her arms are around the child, and from them dangle two sets of bangles. She wears a customary white shawl around her hair and shoulders, which covers the patterned sari she is wearing. Her shoes are pointed at the toe and she wears large anklets.\nAnalysis: This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet to the daily life of an ayah and her white ward, like the owner of the postcard is simply observing the pair as though they were on the street. The sailor outfit of the young ward suggests that the pair are perhaps on a voyage, which speaks to the transcontinental labor that ayahs often engaged in by accompanying their British employers from India to other regions of the British empire. These glimpses into the everyday life of ethnic servants served convey values of Western influence in far off lands, especially the nature of interracial relations. As such, the native characters in these snapshots of imperial life were heavily exoticized and Orientalized: the ayah’s upturned shoes and heavy jewelry speak to a romanticized image of what Indians looked like to the British. The relationship between ayah and her white ward is one of the most intimate of interracial living, and while the French were not as threatened by miscegenation as the British empire, postcards such as this one would have allowed for those back home to witness a glimpse of how comfortable each party was with one another. In presenting this as the norm, the postcard also accomplishes a solidification of the hierarchy of races: this postcard helps to normalize natives as domestic servants for white people. \nMessage: The text, both on the front and back of the postcard, are in French.","analysis":"This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet to the daily life of an ayah and her white ward, like the owner of the postcard is simply observing the pair as though they were on the street.

The postcard, titled “Greetings from the Sunny South,” is captioned saying, “Ol’ Black Mammy.” This Mammy figure, although a disembodied head, is wearing a knotted, bright yellow headdress with a red checkered pattern. The woman has deep red lips and eyes of an almost bluish-hue. Aside from the woman’s head, the cotton flower, and the title/caption, this postcard is a bare white in color. \n\nAnalysis: The Black woman appears to share an essence with the cotton that she is supposed to have produced. In this way, the Black woman (and, more indirectly, the Mammy figure) are asserted to only bear relevance as it relates to the value of their labor. This postcard company has also published similar postcards - with disembodied heads inhabiting a cotton flower - but with other stereotypes of Black people; in this light it is easy to recognize that the overall narrative of this postcard collection is that Black people only hold the value that their produced cotton does.

In the top left corner is a colorful picture of a turkey within a circle. The caption of the postcard reads: “Thanksgiving Greetings.” The children are dressed in fancy attire for their Thanksgiving meal. The girl is wearing a bright pink dress with a similarly colored bow in her hair; the boy is wearing a navy blue suit. The Black woman, on the other hand, is wearing modest work attire: a modest blue blouse, a kerchief, a white apron, and a knotted red headdress with yellow dots. All three figures in the postcard appear to be happy - smiling with their teeth showing. \n\nAnalysis: This Thanksgiving postcard sentimentalizes the presence and the care of the stereotypical Mammy figure. The Mammy is serving the children with a smile, and the children are happy; this imagery serves to justify the narrative of benevolent patriarchalism that suggests that the Mammy figure has the most to gain from this employer-employee relationship.

She is also wearing heeled, white boots and a large hat. She is holding an umbrella in her right hand . The man over her shoulder is wearing a blue overcoat and a top hat. He is holding something in his left hand, maybe a pom pom. The postcard is captioned “Birthday Greetings” at the top right corner. The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, postmarked, and has a stamp. This postcard is part of a series of birthday cards. \nAnalysis: The white-bordered birthday postcard from the early 1900s reproduces the eighteenth century European portraiture tradition of using an ornately attired black servant boy as a status symbol in white portraits. \nThe man’s dark skin allows the viewer to hypothesize that he is of African descent, however, his exact place of origin is deliberately left ambiguous. He both racialized and exoticized at the same time. The purpose of including him in the postcard seems to be Oriental ornamentation. His presence and dark skin is used as a foil to highlight the lady’s immaculate whiteness, shyness, and femininity. Moreover, his placement in the postcard, behind the white girl, supports his ornamentation; he is not the main subject of the image, but the image and story would be incomplete without him. The postcard follows the long tradition of European portraiture that depicted black and brown “boys” serving white mistresses, while leaving their provenance unclear. This racialization and exoticization supports the values of New Imperialism, where Western nations expanded their empires into Africa and Asia, and as a result, had access to labor from those people. These values are so relevant that even though it was a Birthday Greetings postcard, the normalization of racialization and colonization is portrayed in a birthday card.  \nMessage: The message on the verso says “if the pears are ripe the last of next week, let us know what day you are coming to town, maybe Mary will come over that day to see, the Doctor.” Even though the postcard was labeled as a birthday card, the message has nothing to do with birthday wishes meaning the collector, sender, and recipient collectively partake in imperialism through a simple everyday object like a birthday card.","analysis":"The white-bordered birthday postcard from the early 1900s reproduces the eighteenth century European portraiture tradition of using an ornately attired black servant boy as a status symbol in white portraits. \nThe man’s dark skin allows the viewer to hypothesize that he is of African descent, however, his exact place of origin is deliberately left ambiguous.

The male employer also appears to pull the domestic’s body toward him as if caressing her upper chest, which she seems to encourage by placing her delicate white hand over his own. Her status in relation to him is indicated by her simple red collared shirt over which she sports a white apron, while the employer wears a semi-professional suit and striped pants. The employer appears significantly older than the domestic servant. Behind the two, a door is ajar, revealing an old, shocked woman who a viewer may assume is the mistress of the house. With spaced-out teeth and a less conventionally attractive face, it is clear that the object of the employer’s affections is the younger, traditionally beautiful domestic servant. The caption at the bottom of the illustration simply reads “Close contact.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard seeks to convey the sexual impropriety of white working-class domestic servants who mistresses sometimes hesitated to employ out of fears that their husbands would find these often young laborers more attractive and fall for their seductive charms. Rather than making this an illustration of unwanted sexual harassment on part of the employer, this appears to be a clandestine romance that the domestic servant willingly engages in and perhaps even initiates to the same extent as her employer. Since the home was also viewed as a microcosm of empire during the Age of New Imperialism, moreover, it is possible that this postcard is also warning viewers that working-class domestic servants--many of whom were employed as immigrants from European countries and were hard to differentiate in terms of skin complexion and presumed “race” from their employers--would pose a threat to the harmony of the empires they “invaded” just like the hallowed domestic spheres and the marital unions that underpinned them. These illicit affairs between white domestic servants such as the one drawn and their male employers were considered safer to depict than perhaps others, however, because interracial relations could threaten to dilute the supposed white racial purity and superiority on which justifications for empire hinged.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard does not contain a personal message or address, nor is it postmarked, indicating that it was never sent out or was merely handed to an unnamed recipient.","analysis":"This postcard seeks to convey the sexual impropriety of white working-class domestic servants who mistresses sometimes hesitated to employ out of fears that their husbands would find these often young laborers more attractive and fall for their seductive charms.

The words “Servant’s Insurance Act” can be seen at the top right of the postcard as well, underscored as though suggesting its significance to the illustration. Her status as a maid is indicated by her black dress with white trim and a white half-apron, with a ruffled headpiece atop her curly orange hair. She elevates one of her feet, which is crudely bandaged. On the small bedside table that features in the postcard, there are three items atop a tray with the following labels, from left to right: “Bovril,” “Cream,” and “Wine.” At the bottom of the postcard, the text seems to clarify the maid’s situation, and reads: “I burnt my small toe and I don’t mean to work till it is quite better, I prefer to have a burnt toe.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these, even if made somewhat humorous in the postcard present, raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be used as a “beef tea” of sorts and could explain why cream is present on the table as well. One potentially humorous reading of these items is that the “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, as a popular stereotype about “Bridgets” at the time was that they often stole their employers’ food as their own and would even invite unwelcome guests into the house they served to indulge in the supplies.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Dear A., first a card to say they did not do anything to Fred eyes just gave him some eye lotion and (?) oil and he [h]as to go up again will let you know more on Monday when I have (?) day.

Austen Co., Chicago","companyInformation":"J.I. Austen Co., Chicago is a Chicago-based postcard company well known for its patriotic, cartoonish, and fairy-tale-esque prints.","description":"This postcard depicts a cartoon-esque image of anthropomorphic brown bear and gray wolf. The brown bear appears to be a female domestic servant, and the gray wolf appears to be a wealthy male. The bear is sweeping the rug of dirt and accidentally sweeps the dirt onto the wolf, who is just walking through the door into the house. The bear is wearing a plain dress, and a knotted red headdress with white dots; she is sweeping the floor with a wooden broom and a dustpan. The wolf is wearing a three-piece suit, top hat, glasses, and yellow gloves. Both figures display a horrified facial expression. The wolf appears to be the wealthy owner of the house, and employer of the domestic servant bear. The house they are in is ornamented with a nice rug, a stained glass window on the door, and a dark green wall. The title of the postcard reads, “Busy Bears - Thursday,” and is one of a series. \n\nAnalysis: The color of the animals, as well as their respective attire, suggest a binary difference in their respective races and classes. The wolf is a wealthy white man; the bear is a Black servant woman. The bear’s mistake of sweeping the dirt onto the wolf is meant to suggest her incompetence and foolishness - common tropes for Black people, but (interestingly), uncommon for the Mammy figure. This is meant to further the understanding that the wolf is of a “civilized, enlightened,” kind while the bear is of an “uncivilized, foolish” kind. The bear is also clearly racialized in her attire: specifically her headdress. The knotted headdress is meant to remind the viewer of the postcard of the Black woman’s (or, in this case, bear’s) heritage as an “exotic,” “otherized,” figure. \n\nMessage: This card was sent from Wilton, New Hampshire to Boston, Massachusetts. The message reads: “Ain’t this bears [sic] funny Kenneth? This is Mama bear and Papa bear. Love and kisses…” The Kenneth referred to (as the verso of the card specifies) is Kenneth Dunham, a Master at a Boston Childrens’ Hospital. The sender of this card has a different, almost innocent interpretation of the card; an interpretation that suggests that both of the figures are married bears. This interpretation does not seem to recognize the racial and class differences between the figures, which brings about the question: how many of these gendered, racialized, and classist symbols would consciously be recognized by the reader?","analysis":"The color of the animals, as well as their respective attire, suggest a binary difference in their respective races and classes.

The photograph cuts off just below her chest. The figure stares just left of the camera with her hair loose, breasts accentuated, and a pleasant smile on her face. It appears to have been retouched with added color on her red lips, her red necklace, and her clothing. The top text states, “Singhalese Ayah (Nurse Maid).” \nAnalysis: The image depicts what is described as a Sinhalese Ayah: Sinhalese referring to the language and ethnic group located in the British colony of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) and ayahs being the native nursemaids particular to the South Asian region. The focus on this figure is a means of sexualization by the photographer. She looks just away from the camera, seemingly engaging with someone that increases the intrigue of the postcard. The decisive cut off right below her breasts serves to draw attention to them. This postcard follows a style in which photographs eroticize native women under the guise of ethnography; the perceived scientific truth of photographs allows colonial postcards such as this one to depict native women as erotic and available to those who wish to see it. This is evidenced by the clear emphasis placed on the woman’s breasts and the added red lipstick, suggesting promiscuity. Native women in “type” postcards are commonly presented as a fantasy, and represent a particular white, romanticized construction of race—in this case, the “type” is the Sinhalese ayah. Even the use of “ayah” in the text, rather than the subject’s name, serves to depersonalize and homogenize the ayah to further fit the rhetoric of a “type” photograph. She is not herself,  but rather a representation of all Sinhalese ayahs. In the absence of these women, the postcard is a means of having access to this woman. \nMessage: Not in English.","analysis":"The image depicts what is described as a Sinhalese Ayah: Sinhalese referring to the language and ethnic group located in the British colony of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) and ayahs being the native nursemaids particular to the South Asian region.

The scene takes place on a dirt road adjacent to a fenced-off grassy field. The woman is holding a basket of eggs in her left arm, and she drops a few in her effort to move out of the way of the car. She is wearing a dotted dress, boots, and a knotted headdress. The car is being driven by a Black man who appears to have a malicious smile on his face - almost as if he either intended to scare or hit the woman with his car. The man is wearing a leather coat and a cap. Both figures in the caricature feature accentuated, thick lips and large, bulging eyes. In the top right corner of the postcard is the caption: “Lawd A Massy!”\n\nAnalysis: The accentuated, stereotypical facial features of the Black people featured in this cartoon are common for contemporary illustrations: abnormally, comically large lips and eyes. The woman’s attire is also common for the time’s illustrations of Black women. Her dress lacks the elegance of a white woman’s dress, which is an intentional detail to insinuate the relatively low social and economic status of the Black woman. Her knotted headdress is a small remnant of her heritage as an “exotic,” otherized class of people. The Black man in the illustration appears to be malicious and reckless in his driving, perhaps as a nod to the common narrative of the irresponsible, shamelessly hedonistic Black person; the act of driving recklessly is seen as a sign of incivility - a trait commonly ascribed to Black people. The card’s caption, “Lawd A Massy!” (a bastardization of the phrase, “Lord Have Mercy!”) is a reference to the stereotypical speech patterns of Black people, and is seen as a comical symbol of their inadequate, unlearned English skills.","analysis":"The accentuated, stereotypical facial features of the Black people featured in this cartoon are common for contemporary illustrations: abnormally, comically large lips and eyes.

The man has a saddle in his right hand. Behind him and the horse is a barn with a carriage inside and some greenery. The postcard has the caption “Groom.” The verso is not visible. This postcard is part of a series depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian groom. We do not know if the man photographed actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household.

Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols.

Her face holds a puzzled expression and the errors in her speech are meant to signify her lower status. The text at the bottom of this postcard reads, “They call this a music stool, but I’ve been a-twisting and twirling for this last ten minutes, but not a tune does it play.” This caption is meant to be humorous, as the domestic servant misinterprets the function of a “music stool”. Her lower status is further emphasized by the context of her dress within her surroundings. Her background is made up of various elements of finery, signifying her position within a middle class home. The painting in a gold frame, patterned wallpaper, molding on the walls, curtain, and skilled woodwork on the furniture all display a level of wealth without being egregiously excessive. \n\nAnalysis: This scene is a prime example of the “Irish Maggie” stereotype which was coined by the American Russell Brothers in their on-stage performances which ridiculed Irish maidservants. “Maggie” was portrayed as a ditzy woman who took instructions quite literally and seemed to lack logical thinking skills. Her intelligence is further diminished by her misunderstanding of common middle-class household objects, which the contemporary viewer would have found both humorous and self-validating. In the case of this postcard, the Maggie figure was likely intended to appeal to middle class women who employed Irish maidservants, as this caricature affirmed middle class women in their superiority over their workers.

A rickshaw is a vehicle pulled manually, in this case, by a man. These vehicles were typically reserved for white British or the upper class in South Asia. The rickshaw itself is quite large. The ayah sits inside the carrier in white attire, her hair pulled back as she stares at the photographer. Her face is scrunched up, either with laughter or due to the sun. The man at the front of the rickshaw is dressed in a simple dhoti—the wrapped cloth typical for South Asian men—and some kind of headwrap. He does not wear shoes, or accessories of any kind. The setting is a heavily green background.\nAnalysis: From the comical look on the ayah’s face, it is clear that this image would have gotten a chuckle out of British audiences. The photograph subverts typical domestic servant narratives by putting the ayah in the shoes of her employer for the purpose of comedy—asking the viewer to imagine how silly the world would be if ayahs had access to this level of luxury. The way in which the big wheels of the rickshaw seem to overwhelm the ayah contributes to the supposed “outrageousness” of the scene. The photograph also highlights a hierarchy of Indian servants: while it is accepted that the ayah is below her colonial employers, she is still presented as above the Indian man-servant pictured. Her white attire is typical of ayahs in the British employ and are meant to imply a level of “civility” and “culture”.

The lines read as follows: “‘If you please, Ma’am, the cat’s had chickens!’ ‘Nonsense, Bridget! You mean kittens.’ ‘Was them chickens or kittens that master brought home last night?’ ‘Chickens, of course!’ ‘Well, Ma’am, that’s what the cat’s had!’” The mistress and the maid are clearly distinguished in terms of their attire, with the mistress wearing an elaborate yellow dress denoting her wealth while the maid wears traditional domestic attire like a bonnet, apron, and a less imaginative dress. The mistress is seated before the maid and for so facing the viewer, with a book in her lap and looking toward the maid with perhaps an expression of irritation or tolerance. The maid, meanwhile, has one hand outstretched to her mistress as though explaining something and her mouth is ajar, her eyes bulging out as though she is flustered. The two occupy a domestic space like a sitting room, given the armchairs in the background, the familiar wallpaper and picture frames on the back wall. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard features a white domestic servant, who the text identifies as an Irishwoman or a “Bridget” to use the derogatory term. The exchange between the domestic worker and her mistress reveals the ignorance and stupidity of the former which the postcard hoped to convey, as betrayed by her mistaking cats for chickens and still confusing the situation after her mistress corrects the seeming confusion in distinguishing between the two. Her facial expressions are also deliberately made humorous in showing her incredulity at her supposed revelation that a cat has given birth to chickens. This illustration and paired text evoke the popular stereotype that “Bridgets” were unintelligent and naive, especially since many of them hailed from humble backgrounds in rural Ireland without formal training in domestic work. This is directly juxtaposed by the apparent literacy and hinted intellect of the mistress, as indicated by the book on her lap and her swift correction of the domestic’s erroneous logic. A final analysis of this postcard might come through the difference between the domestic and mistress’s clothing, which was important to distinguish at the time to not only indicate a mistress’s superior socioeconomic status, but also to lend her moral and intellectual authority over her maid, since clothing was often viewed as an indication of one’s traits in such regards.\n\nMessage: “Dear Brother & Sister: Am making a cherrie pie for dinner.

Their endeavors were met with great success in the late 1800s and early 1900s, during the “postcard boom.”","description":"In this postcard, a white female domestic servant reclines in a bed with her head against a pillow, reading a paper where the words “Servant’s Insurance Act” appear. The words “Servant’s Insurance Act” can be seen at the top right of the postcard as well, underscored as though suggesting its significance to the illustration. Her status as a maid is indicated by her black dress with white trim and a white half-apron, with a ruffled headpiece atop her curly orange hair. She elevates one of her feet, which is crudely bandaged. On the small bedside table that features in the postcard, there are three items atop a tray with the following labels, from left to right: “Bovril,” “Cream,” and “Wine.” At the bottom of the postcard, the text seems to clarify the maid’s situation, and reads: “I burnt my small toe and I don’t mean to work till it is quite better, I prefer to have a burnt toe.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics.

Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these, even if made somewhat humorous in the postcard present, raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge.

He is also wearing a white turban and is barefoot, and has a gold chain hanging out of his coat. He is standing and holding a tray that carries makings for tea, including numerous teapots and cups for accessories like sugar. He looks away without engaging the viewer. The surrounding area shows a room in the background barely visible with a drawn curtain to symbolize the separation of the rooms. He is standing on a threshold. The postcard contains the caption “KHIDMATGOR (TABLE BOY).” at the bottom of the image. The image is vertical making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. This postcard was “Printed in Germany” and is part of a series of postcards by Moorli Dhur & Sons depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian table-servant called Khidmatgar. We do not know if the man photographed actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe image on the postcard would have been a black and white photograph that was later hand painted into color, known as a hand-tinted photograph. As a hand-tinted work, the artist had discretion over the colors used, and his bright white, blemish-free clothes may have been how he dressed, however, it is arguable that his dress, particularly its coloring, was emphasized as a way to exoticisize him; how could he be laboring all day as a server and be dressed so neatly and brightly? Moreover, he is depicted with a gold chain, presumably a pocket watch. It is debatable whether a man-servant at this time would have owned a pocket watch or if he was decorated as such to portray wealth to the British audience.\nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of an Indian manservant would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nAccording to European gender roles, the Indian servant is performing feminine tasks, and by ethnographically representing Indian men in this manner, the British audience is inclined to assume he, and thus all Indian men, are effeminate.  \nThis postcard is part of a set of postcards illustrating different types of men-servants in British imperial India.

The woman is painted in profile with her full body from head to feet with very little background, making her the central figure of the postcard. Her black hair is tied away in a low bun. She wears a white sari with red borders and, underneath, she wears a deep blue blouse with long sleeves. No part of her body, apart from her hands, feet, and neck upwards is visible. Her feet seemed to be crossed, and in her hand, she holds out a plate or paper of some kind, almost as an offering to an unseen figure.\nAnalysis:  This postcard clearly presents this Madrasi ayah in a service role. Her outstretched hand enhances her role within the domestic framework. Her attire is also of special importance: while the white sari is a typical uniform of native women in local domestic roles, the addition of a long-sleeved blue blouse is a British innovation. This serves to highlight the respectability of the ayah and negate any suspicions of impropriety as Britain grew increasingly anxious about interracial communication and relationships. The fears of miscegenation were projected onto ayah’s bodies as it became uniquely important to hide any illicitness that may have existed in these associations. Intended for a British audience, this postcard serves to dispel anxieties about impropriety but this is not to say that such sexual harrassment did not occur: domestic and sexual labor often went hand in hand in these close, oppressive relationships. In presenting this desexualized figure, the postcard aids in the effort of erasing a history of sexual exploitation. This postcard is also a type image, in that the postcard presents a particular category of native women who then represents a particular white, romanticized construction of race—in this case, the “type” is the Madrasi ayah. Even the use of “ayah” in the text, rather than the subject’s name, serves to depersonalize and homogenize the ayah to further fit the rhetoric of a “type” photograph. She is not herself,  but rather a representation of all Madrasi ayahs. \nMessage: N/A","analysis":"This postcard clearly presents this Madrasi ayah in a service role.

It was started by James Bamforth in 1870 and was best known in the early 1900s in the U.K. for its topographical, tourist, and especially seaside postcards.","description":"The front of the card contains a dialogue that presumably transpires between the white domestic servant clad in a blue apron and bonnet and a white child pictured in a nursery, while the former is drying the latter after a bath. The child inquires, “Why can’t I dry myself, Nurse?” to which she replies, “Because I’m stronger than you, dear.” The child then reasons, “Well, my Daddy’s stronger than you, so does he dry you?” The small bath which the child used to bathe is pictured off to the side, and the child is standing on a towel to avoid getting the ground wet as he or she dries off. The child’s bed is elevated from the ground and appears in the background, along with some clothes into which he or she will presumably change. The child stands with his back turned to the viewer, while the white domestic servant kneels down as she holds a towel over the child’s body and looks down at him or her with her mouth slightly ajar.\n\nAnalysis: This image conveys a white domestic servant who bathed and is now drying off a child in her charge, the son or daughter of her employer. When the child asks her--albeit with a likely innocence--if his father dries her, the message can also imply that there are clandestine sexual relations between the white nurse and her male employer. If the maid were not white, an illustrator may refrain from suggesting sexual ties between domestic and employer, given prominent fears that interracial relations and miscegenation could obscure the boundaries between races when white’s supposed superiority played such a large role in maintaing Empire.  The text also hints that perhaps only the child’s father is stronger than her, not the youth’s mother, which may reflect stereotypes that portrayed immigrant domestics like Irishwoman as more muscular and masculine than their English-born counterparts and hence better suited for laborious household chores. \nWhile contemporary viewers would perhaps find the text humorous, others could perceive a threat within the implied liaison, given that it could violate the sanctity of a marriage and the domestic nurse could signify a seemingly innocuous intruder in the hallowed domestic space. The domestic space was also regarded frequently as a microcosm of an empire, so if considered with this in mind, this postcard could also inspire xenophobic concerns about white immigrants from places like Ireland invading countries like England and undermining its unity and core elements from within. Finally, the postcard image may evince fears of Britons at the time that white immigrant female servants--like the stereotyped Irish “Bridget”--would replace mothers in especially middle-class homes that employed them because of the nurse’s close proximity to the child, performing childcare roles much like a “surrogate mother” even if their receiving countries took pains to undermine their ties to parenthood over such children.\n\nMessage:  The verso of the card has no personal message, so it is possible that this postcard was handed to its intended recipient in person. It is also possible that this postcard was never sent.","analysis":"This image conveys a white domestic servant who bathed and is now drying off a child in her charge, the son or daughter of her employer.

Henry, New York Druggist.","description":". This folding trade card depicts a frail and sickly man walking around New York and suffering from consumption. He is described to be living some of the last days of his life until he sees a sign for Dr. William Hall’s Balsam products, which claim to cure any and all ailments of the lungs.  By unfolding the card, it reveals that the man is now a “portly and healthy” man ready to serve his wife, children, and Black servant. Hall’s insists that taking their liquid medication will cure a person of their cough as well as extend their lifetime, making them the 19th century man they need to be. \nAnalysis: The placement of a Black domestic worker amongst the family of the man cured by Hall’s lung treatment better reflects the hierarchy of family life. The white father is in the center of the frame with his white wife huddling by his side, while the Black domestic worker is off center and smaller, caring for the small child in her arms. The Black woman in this picture appears as a standard of family life, as important as a child but without the power of the mistress and master she serves.  Hall’s exaggerates the story of a sick man being cured and made healthy as a testament to the product. Viewers are meant to look upon the first depiction of the man with pity, feeling sorry that he has such a short time left to live. However, opening the folded card gives the viewer a sense of relief and confidence towards the product he is advertising. The family around her, all in various states of happiness, are meant to represent the audience’s joy towards the success of the product. Each person, including the baby, seems to reach out towards the bottle to share some of that joy with themselves. \n As opposed to the white family around her, the Black servant is drawn in an exaggerated and unrealistic style, with huge, undetailed eyes and large red lips. She serves as the comedic relief in an otherwise serious advertisement.","analysis":"The placement of a Black domestic worker amongst the family of the man cured by Hall’s lung treatment better reflects the hierarchy of family life.

On the right half of the image, the white man sits with his legs sprawled out across the arms of a chair. His body is clearly weak, and he cries out in the direction of the servant, yelling, “BOY!” On the other side, the Orientalized caricature of a Chinese servant comes running in, holding a tray of ice and a refreshing beverage. This figure is depicted in a stereotypical full-length robe and has a long ponytail extending from the crown of his otherwise bald head. He is pictured running in with prompt service. The entire scene takes place in an outdoor setting, with a railing lining the scene in the background. In the bottom left corner, “The Call of the East” labels the image. \nAnalysis: This postcard displays a colonial relationship between a Western and Eastern man. The Western white men were weak and debilitated in the heat of the tropics. They had to call upon the Asian natives to help them out, since they were viewed as fit and strong in the tropics.

The dialogue contributes to an on-going effort to infantilize and emasculate Chinese men-servants. By removing any sense of a mature masculine identity, the servants were asexualized and void of any threats they posed as a male in domestic service.

Their endeavors were met with great success in the late 1800s and early 1900s, during the “postcard boom.”","description":"In this postcard, a white female domestic servant reclines in a bed with her head against a pillow, reading a paper where the words “Servant’s Insurance Act” appear. The words “Servant’s Insurance Act” can be seen at the top right of the postcard as well, underscored as though suggesting its significance to the illustration. Her status as a maid is indicated by her black dress with white trim and a white half-apron, with a ruffled headpiece atop her curly orange hair. She elevates one of her feet, which is crudely bandaged. On the small bedside table that features in the postcard, there are three items atop a tray with the following labels, from left to right: “Bovril,” “Cream,” and “Wine.” At the bottom of the postcard, the text seems to clarify the maid’s situation, and reads: “I burnt my small toe and I don’t mean to work till it is quite better, I prefer to have a burnt toe.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these, even if made somewhat humorous in the postcard present, raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be used as a “beef tea” of sorts and could explain why cream is present on the table as well. One potentially humorous reading of these items is that the “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, as a popular stereotype about “Bridgets” at the time was that they often stole their employers’ food as their own and would even invite unwelcome guests into the house they served to indulge in the supplies.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard reads as follows: “Dear A., first a card to say they did not do anything to Fred eyes just gave him some eye lotion and (?) oil and he [h]as to go up again will let you know more on Monday when I have (?) day.

The woman can be identified as a domestic servant by her engagement in the act of managing laundry, as well as her frilled collar which was a common adornment of female servants in the early 20th century. The man appears to be wearing a striped shirt, his hair unkempt, and his eyebrows raised as if in surprise. A staircase and wall light are visible in the background of this scene, indicating that they are within a household. The caption at the bottom of this composition says, “Here are your new trousers, Sir, I’ve ironed those beastly creases out!” \n\nAnalysis: Based on the text accompanying this image, it can be inferred that the man pictured is the male head of household, or “master” as he would have been addressed. The domestic servant has completed a chore for him, and she has come to his door to present him with the product. However, the man’s striped shirt, messy hair, and look of shock indicate that he was not expecting a visit from the servant and that he was most likely in his private bedroom. During the early 20th century, jokes about a female servant’s proximity to the intimate spaces of their male employers were circulated. This was seen as a scandalous consequence of hiring live-in servants, but it also functioned as a source of humor for the artist’s contemporaries. \n\nThis postcard was sent to a Miss Mabel Gutheridge in Bruce, Wisconsin in the year 1910.

Her expression appears to be somewhat smug due to her closed-mouth smile and raised eyebrows. The woman to her right sits in a red armchair and looks surprised, while the man behind her sits at a desk and looks to be angry. The three characters are situated in a well-furnished room which includes a full bookshelf topped by a statue, several framed paintings, a chaise, and tall yellow curtains upon a large window. The caption at the bottom of this composition says, “What was that terrible crash?/ I tripped on the carpet, and the tea-things fell, ma’am/ Did you manage to save anything?/ Yes, ma’am. I kept hold of the tray all right.” \n\nAnalysis: The text on this postcard frames the servant as both clumsy and incompetent, and one who does not satisfy her employer’s expectations. It is clear to the reader that one of the employers, most likely the mistress who had closer contact with her domestic staff, intended to ask if any of the tea items were salvaged. However, the servant replied by saying that she was able to hold on to the serving tray- a misunderstanding which frustrates the employers. This scene is a prime example of the “Irish Maggie” stereotype which was coined by the American Russell Brothers in their on-stage performances which ridiculed Irish maidservants. “Maggie” was portrayed as a ditzy woman who incorrectly interpreted common phrases and seemed to lack logical thinking skills. Her intelligence is further diminished by her misunderstanding of common middle-class household objects, which the contemporary viewer would have found both humorous and self-validating. In the case of this postcard, the Maggie figure was likely intended to appeal to middle class women who employed Irish maidservants, as this caricature affirmed middle class women in their superiority over their workers.

She is dressed in a blue-white vertical striped dress, slippers, and a white apron. On her head she wears a knotted, red head-dress with Black dots. The woman is shapely with an accentuated stomach. The illustration places emphasis on her large eyes and large red lips; her eyes are nearly entirely Black, as if void of a human gaze. At the bottom of the postcard, the title “Aunt Dinah” is written. The only subject of the illustration is the servant woman - the background is a blank beige in color and texture.\nAnalysis: The image depicts a Black servant woman, presumably on her way to serve cake to her employer. Her soulless eyes and accentuated red lips are enough to denote her as a Black woman, forgetting the color of her skin; her face is very clearly racialized in a style common to the time period and medium. Her body is approximate to any contemporary individual’s conception of the Mammy: desexualized entirely, with an emphasis on her almost masculinized stature and shape. Her attire is indicative of her position as a servant woman, given her apron and plain dress. The headdress she wears is typical of a racialized (almost exoticized) depiction of a Black woman; although she has been domesticated as a servant to her presumably white employer, she still maintains some physical characteristics that are expected of a woman who is perceived as foreign, and “other.” She is referred to as “Aunt Dinah” as a way of denoting her position as an almost family member to a supposedly benevolent patriarch. The spelling of the name “Dinah” is meant to evoke images of a racialized character who is hardly literate, does not speak in a typical way, and is ultimately inherently uncivilized. \nMessage : The message on the verso reads “Raymond Blue / from Hellen.” There is not too much that can be gleaned from this message, though the postcard likely was not mailed, as there is no stamp.","analysis":"The image depicts a Black servant woman, presumably on her way to serve cake to her employer.

As she stands in the door frame, the employer is still in his bed underneath white covers, the only visible part of him being his head. His facial expression is one of utter shock as he fixes the maidservant in a stare of utter horror, his cheeks noticeably red. On the bottom of the postcard, the following exchange between the two figures is provided, beginning with the flustered inquiry of the employer. “‘Why the dickens don’t you knock?’” he demands, to which the female domestic replies, “‘Oh, it’s all right, Sir. I always look through the keyhole before I come in!’” It is possible that this card is a hand-tinted photograph due to the rather subdued coloring for the figures’ skin despite the over-saturated appearance of the bed frame or the door, although the front nor the verso discloses such details.\n\nAnalysis: The look of perturbed shock on the male employer’s face directed toward the white domestic servant, when coupled with the textual revelation that the maidservant routinely looks through the keyhole before she announces her entry into his room, suggests that this female employee has been eavesdropping and likely ogling her male employer from afar. Servants such as the one illustrated were often conveyed as deliberately nosy and likely to lazily evade her labor in favor of overhearing gossip or prying into the personal lives of her employers. In this case, the fact that the domestic servant was watching her male employer unnoticed in particular even imbues this depiction of the laborer with a lecherous undertone, indicating that perhaps she was admiring him. It was often worried that white female working-class maidservants were promiscuous and, because of their light skin complexion and also a rumored affinity for the wardrobe of higher classes, that they could even pass for their employers. Their more ambiguous racial status compared to that of darker-skinned domestic servants also enabled them, mistresses feared, to be more desirable to their husbands and perhaps seduce them into acts of infidelity that would degrade not only the domestic harmony of the house so fervently emphasized the Age of New Imperialism, but also the power that the lady of the house was seen as entitled to in that hallowed sphere. \n\nMessage:  The verso has no personal message, but the address indicates and stamp indicate that it was sent to a certain “Albert Stregl” in “Lidgerwood, N.D.”","analysis":"The look of perturbed shock on the male employer’s face directed toward the white domestic servant, when coupled with the textual revelation that the maidservant routinely looks through the keyhole before she announces her entry into his room, suggests that this female employee has been eavesdropping and likely ogling her male employer from afar.

The scene is staged in front of a coop and a wire fence. The bird is colorful, with bright green, yellow, and white feathers. The woman is wearing a brown shawl with green stripes, a green blouse, a pinstripe apron, and a colorful knotted headdress. The Black woman’s lips are colored a bright red. The woman is looking down at the turkey with an inspecting gaze. The postcard is captioned, “Turkey Looks Good to Mammy.” \n\nAnalysis: This postcard labels the Black woman as a Mammy, who is presumably picking out a turkey to prepare and serve to her wealthy employers. The most brightly colored parts of this image are the turkey’s feathers, the woman’s headdress, and the woman’s lips. Her headdress and lips are significant, since both serve to racialize her. Thick, bright red lips are common in caricatures of Black people; Black women are generally adorned with a bright knotted headdress as a means of bringing to mind their heritage as an “otherized,” “exotic,” people.

The most brightly colored parts of this image are the turkey’s feathers, the woman’s headdress, and the woman’s lips. Her headdress and lips are significant, since both serve to racialize her. Thick, bright red lips are common in caricatures of Black people; Black women are generally adorned with a bright knotted headdress as a means of bringing to mind their heritage as an “otherized,” “exotic,” people.

The postcards were commonly printed in Germany.","description":"The postcard features a simple sketch of an ayah and her young, white, female ward. The colored-in rendering takes place on some kind of a platform: the white child stands on a raised platform and grips a railing located at the end of it. The young child, presumably a little girl, faces away from the viewer. From what we can see, she wears a black dress with a white square border around the neck and white lace details on the end of the sleeves. She wears a hat, underneath which her blonde hair peeks out. Behind her, in a protective position, stands a native Indian woman. Her face is more visible, seen in profile, as she looks at the same thing her ward is. Her arms are around the child, and from them dangle two sets of silver bangles. She wears a customary shawl in yellow around her hair and shoulders, which covers the patterned sari she is wearing. Her shoes are pointed at the toe and she wears large silver anklets. \nAnalysis: This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet to the daily life of an ayah and her white ward, like the owner of the postcard is simply observing the pair as though they were on the street. These glimpses into the everyday life of ethnic servants served convey values of British dominance in far off lands, especially the nature of interracial relations. The relationship between ayah and her white ward is one of the most intimate of interracial living, postcards such as this one would have allowed for those back home to witness a glimpse of how comfortable each party was with one another. In presenting this as the norm, the postcard also accomplishes a solidification of the hierarchy of races: this postcard helps to normalize natives as domestic servants for white people. In this colorized version of the postcard, the bright colors of the ayah’s clothing stands in contrast to the serious black and white clothing of the child. The later addition of color to the card suggests the intentionality of the color choice: India and its inhabitants are further romanticized and exoticized, while even children of the British empire wear practical and serious clothing. \nMessage: “Lady Gloria, Very sorry could not meet you as arranged on Friday but I suppose I shall not see you till Sunday now. Shall try and come over to see your Pa. (You know what for.) Hope all is well.” Addressed to a “Miss Campion” of Godwin Rd.","analysis":"This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet to the daily life of an ayah and her white ward, like the owner of the postcard is simply observing the pair as though they were on the street.

Despite her injuries, she grins from ear to ear and the dialogue to her right reads, “I don’t care how often I get hurt now, I am insured.” On a bedside table to the left, there is a dish of red grapes and a cup labeled “Beef Tea”, suggesting that she is being well-fed during her time of healing. Beef Tea was made from a shelf-stable beef stock called ‘Bovril’, which was marketed as highly nutritious and associated with good health. \n\nAnalysis: The illustrator of this postcard suggests that female domestic servants were pleased with the benefits offered by Servant’s Insurance Act, and that they used these novel legal protections to shirk their working responsibilities. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers who made less than £160 per year were entitled to mandatory paid medical leave for up to 26 weeks. Sometimes they were also eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Predictably, this requirement was a source of outrage for employers who were responsible for the payments. One can also infer that the postcard’s illustrator intended to criticize Irish immigrant domestic workers, which were pejoratively referred to as “Bridgets”. (See “Bridget'' tag on the Explore page for more information.) Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to continually injure herself in order to rest in bed. The items on the bedside table, particularly the grapes, could be interpreted as having a connotation with wine, thus invoking an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. Another reading of the grapes could be as a signifier of recreation and indulgence, as European paintings often include grapes in scenes of Greek symposia in which guests would recline for a meal and participate in recreational activities. The “beef tea” on the table was made from a Bovril, a thick and salty shelf-stable meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine. From the time of its invention in the 1870’s, Bovril was marketed as nutritious and protein-rich food that could restore one’s health and strength. One reading of these items, which the contemporary viewer would have found humorous, is that “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, with the secret intention to indulge in the supplies. \n\nThis postcard was not postmarked or addressed to its recipient.

She is holding a rabbit by the ears and saying, as the caption reads, “Dis am sho good luck.” She is wearing a white, dotted shirt that is tucked into a yellow and black striped skirt. To complete her outfit, she is wearing a white apron, sturdy boots, and a green and white bonnet. The woman’s face is centered around a pair of thick, bright lips in the shape of a smile. She stands outside, in front of what appears to be a small, worn-down house. One of the windows is broken, and placed in front of the house is a wooden wash basin. At the bottom of the postcard lies its title: “Good Luck.” This postcard is noted as being eleventh in a series.\n\nAnalysis: The woman is racialized as stereotypically Black in a number of ways. First, her face features thick, red lips (which is very common for contemporary caricatures of Black people); she is also portrayed as having an almost masculine (certainly not stereotypically feminine) stature and shape, which is a comment on the perceived ugliness of Black women. Second, her attire is mismatched and plain, she appears to have been using a wash basin, and her house is worn-down and seemingly uncomfortable; these things signify her position as relatively low on the social ladder (another common stereotype for Black people). She is a working woman, evident in her apron and boots, which is another indicator of her marginalization - a middle class white woman (a part of this postcard’s audience) would not be depicted in this way. The caption, “Dis am sho good luck,” is meant to be a bastardized and broken way of saying, “This is so I have good luck.” Oftentimes in caricatures (as well as other written or staged media), Black people are shown as having poor language skills - this case is particularly egregious. The rabbit she is holding, as the character is supposed to proclaim, will grant the woman good luck. This is the crux of the joke; the woman is depicted as being superstitious and irrational (which fits nicely in common narratives of Black people). \n\nMessage: This postcard was sent from St. Louis, Missouri to [?]. The sender’s message for the recipient lies on the front of the card, underneath the caricature. It reads: “Our daughter arrived this morning March 26 at 5:10.” There is no mention made of or any reflection on the image on the card. The sender was relaying the news of the birth of his child, and thought this card to be an appropriate vessel for such a message. Although unimaginable to our modern sensibilities, the sender’s nonchalance about the postcard’s image speaks to the widespread dissemination and comfort with these racial narratives.

In the painting, a light-skinned woman reclines nude except for shoes, jewelry, and a hairpiece. She gazes out directly at the viewer and lays one of her hands over her legs to obscure her pubic area. She is supported by three large pillows and lays on a decorative textile covering a piece of furniture. A black cat arches its back as it stands at her feet, but it is mostly camouflaged by the painting’s dark background. A dark-skinned woman stands by her side, offering a bouquet of flowers. Her face is barely visible, as well, due to the dark colors used for her skin tone and the background. Due to these color choices, the viewer’s gaze is directed towards the reclining nude whose whiteness is emphasized. \n\nAnalysis: During the time of this painting’s production, the French empire had a number of colonial presences in African countries. This generated a voyeuristic interest in the colonized subjects, who were often reduced to objectified forms of representation. Manet’s Olympia depicts a French sex-worker in her private quarters where she would have recieved clients being attended to by a Black servant. The Black woman behind her was based on the likeness of the art model Laure, who presents the sex-worker with a bouquet of flowers. When this painting was presented to the French Salon upon its completion, it caused a scandal amongst art critics, journalists, members of high-society, and the general public. However, this scandal was due to the provocative nature of the sex-worker’s direct gaze towards the viewer, which subverted the European tradition of depicting submissive female nudes who invite the male gaze and did not interact with that gaze; they exist fully in service to the viewer or the figures in their surroundnings. The scandal did not mention the use of a Black figure as little more than a clothed prop to accentuate the sensual repose of the light-skinned figure. This imagery upholds the harmful colonial iconographic tradition of positioning dark-skinned bodies in perpetual service of a white body. \n\nMessage: This postcard contains no personal messages or addresses on its verso. The postcard was likely unmailed, given the absence of a stamp.","analysis":"During the time of this painting’s production, the French empire had a number of colonial presences in African countries.

In the bottom left corner, there is a caption titled “CALCUTTA COOLIES.” The verso is not split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. The verso also includes a description of “Calcutta Coolies”: “The Coolies of Calcutta, otherwise porters or carriers, are men of fine physique, and are able to carry exceptionally heavy weights supported on their heads. Coolie labourers form an enormous body of men in the East, no less than 70,000 journeying yearly from India to Ceylon. The word Coolie is derived from the Hindustani Kûli, a labourer.”\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subjects depicted are Indian servants called “coolies.” We do not know if the men photographed actually worked as domestic servants in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe image on the postcard would have been a black and white photograph that was later hand painted into color, known as a hand-tinted photograph. As a hand-tinted work, the artist had discretion over the colors used, and grossly racialized these workers. Their place of origin would be unclear if the caption “Calcutta” was not included. \nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of an Indian manservant would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nBy labeling these men as “coolies,” it signifies that they are from from dalit, the “untouchable” caste in Indian society, and their labor was stigmatized.  They may have been indentured servants. Through the incredible racialization, lack of European clothing standards and derogatory terms used, the postcard speaks to the British imperial constructions of black and white. These men are degraded as primitive, through their dark skin, limited clothing, and hand woven baskets, and that reinforced the British imperial mission. \nAdditionally, according to European gender roles, the Indian servants are performing feminine tasks, and by ethnographically representing Indian men in this manner, the British audience is inclined to assume they, and thus all Indian men, are effeminate.  \nMessage: The message on the verso mocks the broken English of “coolies” who were often present at docks and train stations haggling newly arriving British families by offering their services as porters to earn some income. The message makes fun of the “coolies’” speech and caricatures their livelihood: “Carry your parcel Sar” “Only one anna want it Sar” “Take it Coolie Sar.” “Sar” refers to Sir which the “coolies” pronounced as “Sar.” Anna was a currency unit in British India","analysis":"This is an ethnographic “type” postcard.

The domestic is clad in a simple, trim blue dress, a white apron and bonnet, denoting her occupation. The officer is dressed in a bright red and deep blue or black military uniform, and he is bending toward the domestic servant with an almost goofy grin across his face and his cheeks burning a furious shade of red. The domestic has one arm around the officer’s while she meets the officer’s gaze, bending congenially as though in greeting and blushing as her other hand outstretched behind her as though beckoning the officer to sit down at the dining table on the far left of the postcard. On the tablecloth rests a pitcher, two bottles that perhaps contain liquor, and some other food and utensils. The bottom of the postcard reads, “The officers here are very nice. The ‘General’ often asks me in to supper!”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard is thoughtfully designed to portray the white working-class maidservant as a stupid or naive, promiscuous, and lazy domestic. For one, the blushing of both the domestic and the officer--along with the former’s agreement to dine with the other--hints at the domestic servant’s willingness to allow a male stranger into her employer’s home and likely conduct a clandestine relationship with him. Often, stereotypes proliferated about working-class white maidservants lacking the sexual propriety and morality of their middle-class mistresses, and such beliefs are evident in this postcard. In addition, it was believed that many of these domestics were also indolent, shirking their domestic responsibilities by plundering their employer's food for themselves and inviting unwanted guests into their employer’s home while those they served were away. This postcard helps validate all of these suspicions in a way that would have been both infuriating and comedic to contemporary viewers. Finally, the domestic’s stupidity or at least naivety--perhaps attributed by those at the time to her low socioeconomic status--is indicated by the text accompanying the illustration, which suggests her belief that the officers aer asking her into supper without ulterior motives or when this is the house that she is to be overseeing instead. All in all, these negative characteristics assigned to the domestic servant capitalize on many fears and parallel rude commentaries held by employers and the American and European public in regards to such laborers during the Age of Imperialism.\n\nMessage: There is no message or address on the verso, nor is there a postmark. This indicates that this postcard was never sent and perhaps never had a recipient, unless it was hand-delivered. Perhaps someone purchased it for a personal collection.","analysis":"This postcard is thoughtfully designed to portray the white working-class maidservant as a stupid or naive, promiscuous, and lazy domestic.

The name “Bridget” is enough to identify her as an Irish domestic worker. \n\nAnalysis: The “Irish Bridget” was a stereotype used to describe female domestic servants who immigrated to the US from Ireland between the 1840s and 1930s. This caricatured figure got its name from an important Irish Catholic figure, Saint Brigid, which was also a popular name for girls in the mid-19th century. Irish maid servants were privately hired by the heads of households in urban American settings, with whom they typically lived throughout their time of employment as domestic workers. It was extremely common for middle-class white Americans in the urban east to hire an Irish servant as a means of displaying their social status and to assert the family’s position within the refinement of a growing middle class. The idea of “refinement” was defined, in part, by positioning oneself in moral opposition to another group. Irish maidservants served as a scapegoat for this moral opposition, and thus the “Bridget” caricature was developed. One major way that a family’s respectability was assessed was based on their adherence to (Protestant) Christian morality. Irish immigrants, being primarily Catholic, were therefore automatically othered. In order to cast-out Irish immigrants, “Bridget” could be portrayed as unintelligent, lazy, ignorant, pretentious, defiant, demanding, and unaware of the parameters of their social status. In the image depicted above, the Irish servant is characterized as the lazy and defiant “Bridget”.","analysis":"The “Irish Bridget” was a stereotype used to describe female domestic servants who immigrated to the US from Ireland between the 1840s and 1930s.

In this scene, the character Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) is tying the corset of the character Scarlet O’Hara (Vivien Leigh). The Mammy character is standing behind O’Hara, while O’Hara stands upright with her hands holding onto a bureau for balance. Mammy is wearing a standard maid uniform: a black blouse, a white skirt, a white apron, and a knotted white headdress. O’Hara is looking back over her shoulder at Mammy, who is returning her gaze with an attentive (perhaps concerned) expression. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard (and the film from which this image derives) seeks to distinguish the Mammy from O’Hara on the basis of race, socio-economic class, and traditional femininity. Mammy is very clearly racialized in her labor as a domestic worker, and also with her headdress: the headdress is an article of clothing usually given to stereotypes of Black women as a means of evoking their heritage as an “otherized,” “exotic” people. Their difference in attire (O’Hara’s corset and fancy dress; Mammy’s maid uniform) marks a clear difference between their relative status in class and social hierarchies. Finally, Mammy is purposely portrayed as lacking physical qualities that would make her fit the traditional mold of white upper-class femininity; with her Black skin, round face and broad shoulders, she is meant to stand in clear contrast with O’Hara’s white skin and slender build. Gone With The Wind features a scene toward the end of the film where Mammy fights off a Black liberation battalion that was sent to free slaves - like Mammy. This scene insists on the benevolent presence of enslavers, and suggests that characters like Mammy are more than happy to physically fight against her own freedom so that she may stay with her enslavers. In this way, Gone With The Wind memorializes and sentimentalizes the American South’s history of slavery.","analysis":"This postcard (and the film from which this image derives) seeks to distinguish the Mammy from O’Hara on the basis of race, socio-economic class, and traditional femininity.

The children are dressed very similarly: a pink dress, a white lace collar, black stockings, and black boots. Each child is straight-faced, and holding flowers. On the verso of the postcard is the word “postcard” written in various languages: German, French, English, Dutch, and others.

She is more traditionally racialized in her attire - an apron, which is common for depictions of Black women. Her care for white children is also common in stereotypical depictions of Black women, who are said to prefer the white children they are hired to care for over their own Black children and family.

There are 13 men photographed with six standing and seven sitting. 11 of the men are looking at the photographer while two are looking away from the viewer. 11 of the men are wearing turbans. They are photographed outside of an indistinguishable building on grass. In the bottom right corner, there is a caption titled “A GROUP OF NATIVE SERVANTS.” The verso is not split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. \nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subjects depicted are Indian servants. We do not know if the men photographed actually worked as domestic servants in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe image on the postcard would have been a black and white photograph that was later hand painted into color, known as a hand-tinted photograph. As a hand-tinted work, the artist had discretion over the colors used, and their bright white, blemish-free clothes may have been how they dressed, however, it is arguable that their dress, particularly its coloring, was emphasized as a way to exoticisize them; how could they be laboring all day and be dressed so neatly and brightly?\nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what Indian men-servants look like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of Indian men-servants would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nThrough distribution by the Universal Postal Union, an international postal system, the imperial values of the Western empires are perpetuated without border restrictions. This supports the normalization of imperial, racist beliefs about people colonized during New Imperialism. \nMessage: n/a","analysis":"This is an ethnographic “type” postcard.

This supports the normalization of imperial, racist beliefs about people colonized during New Imperialism. \nMessage: n/a","message":"n/a","__v":0,"imageLinks":[{"_id":"67081b4267fa9da418a0040c","name":"217B","link":"/images/postcards/217B.jpg","size":{"width":1136,"height":1720},"orientation":1,"cardNumber":217},{"_id":"67081b4267fa9da418a0040d","name":"217A","link":"/images/postcards/217A.jpg","size":{"width":1148,"height":1715},"orientation":1,"cardNumber":217}],"originalLocation":{"latitude":-34.9604808,"longitude":138.5596913,"_id":"67ccb20c6c89aaaae23d419e"},"isBlurByDefault":false,"isInScrapbook":false,"themes":["Anthropological/ethnographic","South Asia","Orientalism","Photographic","Hand Tinted","Men-servants","New Imperialism"]},{"_id":"670580841d3345f198753ca5","number":124,"item":"postcard","date":null,"postmarked":"No","place":"Ceylon","company":"Plate & Co","companyInformation":"Founded in 1890 by a German couple, Plate & Co featured photographs on their postcards, most of which were printed in Germany.

The text at the bottom of the image reads, “Colombo. Singhalese Ayah.” Colombo refers to the capital city of Ceylon and Singhalese refers to a major ethnic group in the region. The woman herself is looking just left of the camera with her hair pulled back and a toothy smile. Around her neck is a relatively large necklace and pendant and she wears earrings as well. Her attire is European: a frilly white blouse that remains unbuttoned and what seems to be a skirt. Her hands come together in the front to hold open her blouse, exposing a breast to the viewer.\nAnalysis: This postcard makes no attempt to hide the sexualization of this particular ayah. Like other “type” photographs that are bust level, the goal in this image is to showcase the ayah’s breasts. Scholar Malek Alloula writes that, in being “reduced to what is enticing about them, these women can only efface themselves behind their own breasts.” This could be an example of the blatant sexualization of native women, which was incredibly common, or alternatively, a means of highlighting the ayah’s role as a caretaker of children. Either way, the sly look away from the camera coupled with the framing of her breasts with the fall of the blouse serves to eroticize native women under the guise of ethnography; the perceived scientific truth of photographs allows colonial postcards such as this one to depict native women as erotic and available to those who wish to see it. Through this “type” postcard, meant to display white constructed notions of racial distinctions, native women become an exoticized fantasy for foreign men, suggesting that these women make themselves readily accessible for men. While the British strove to desexualize ayahs to ensure the moral integrity of their empire, this postcard (in French?) presents ayahs as sexual objects. \nMessage: None.","analysis":"This postcard makes no attempt to hide the sexualization of this particular ayah.

One woman sits on a wooden table while the other woman stands to the right. The woman to the left is dressed casually in house clothes, while the woman to the right wears a bright red coat with a fur scarf and muff. A shelf lined with various cookware hangs on a wall behind them, and a curtain to the right is drawn open. The text at the bottom of this composition reads, “‘Do you think you can take up the burden of the house?’/ ‘Well, I carried him in last night, but I wasn’t going to say anything about it.’” \n\nAnalysis: In this scene where two women converse within a home, it can be inferred that one woman lives there while the other is a visitor. The woman to the right wears a look of shock and is dressed in cold-weather clothes, indicating that she has recently entered the house; she is either having a brief visit or has not yet taken off her coat. The quality of her garments also tells the viewer that she is a member of the upper-middle or upper class. The woman to the left’s social status is more ambiguous, although her modest style of dress may indicate that she is of a lower class; perhaps she is a domestic servant to an upper-middle class family, although this interpretation complicates the understanding of her interaction with an upper-class woman. The text below them is clearly meant to be a humorous exchange based on the word play with the phrase “take up the burden of the house”. The second line of dialogue jokes that the “burden of the house” was a man who one of the women had to carry into the house, although the original meaning of the phrase is unclear. The joke may be alluding to the drunken state of the house “master” or an illicit sexual encounter. Any further reading is unclear. \n\nThis postcard was not mailed and does not include a personal message.","analysis":"In this scene where two women converse within a home, it can be inferred that one woman lives there while the other is a visitor.

The difference in attire is perhaps the most obvious signifier of their socio-economic differences. Besides her dress, the woman in black and white can be identified as an Irish domestic servant, because of the vernacular used in the postcard’s subtitles, specifically the use of the word “mum”. On the bottom left of this card, the text reads, “Whatever are you doing?/ Sure, Mum, ye told me to pull down the blind.” \n\nAnalysis: The Boston Pilot published a joke about Irish maidservants in which a similar vernacular is used. Her employer speaks in ‘proper’ English, while the Irish servant speaks in broken phrases with words misspelled and the word “mum” interspersed throughout her speech. This contrasting use of English positions the Irish servant as intellectually and socially inferior to her employer, who she calls “mum”. The text also highlights the Irish servant’s misinterpretation of her employer's instructions, which she took quite literally. Rather than pulling down the blinds to shade the room from the sunlight, the Irish servant took the blinds entirely off of the window, much to her employer's dissatisfaction and unamusement. This scene is a prime example of the “Irish Maggie” stereotype which was coined by the American Russell Brothers in their on-stage performances which ridiculed Irish maidservants. “Maggie” was portrayed as a ditzy woman who took instructions quite literally and seemed to lack logical thinking skills. Her intelligence is further diminished by her misunderstanding of common middle-class household objects, which the contemporary viewer would have found both humorous and self-validating. In the case of this postcard, the Maggie figure was likely intended to appeal to middle class women who employed Irish maidservants, as this caricature affirmed middle class women in their superiority over their workers. Anxiety circulated about women’s roles and class disparity within those gender roles at the time of this postcard’s circulation. \n\nSent to a Mr. Emil J. Swenson in Salina Kansas.

As he sneaks up on her unawares, her tray with plates, a spoon, a cup, and unidentifiable food begins its descent to the floor. The maid has blonde hair, a slim physique, and is blushing slightly as though embarrassed as her eyes widen as they look back at the male employer, who is very stout in contrast and clearly old with sideburns and a sizable nose. He is dressed in what resembles a bedrobe. In a door that stands ajar in the right-hand side of the postcard, a seemingly young woman with a sweeping yellow dress evocative of upper-class fashion looks into the room with her mouth drawn into an “o” of surprise, her thin eyebrows raised. On the bottom right, there is text that reads “Pa-in-law makes himself too familiar with the servants,” likely from the perspective of the male employer’s daughter-in-law lingering in the doorway.\n\nAnalysis: In this postcard, it is clear that the viewer is witnessing an act of sexual impropriety between the female domestic servant and her employer. Typical representations of such domestics during the Age of Imperialism portrayed them as knowingly seductive and as a threat to the marital unions that underpinned the hallowed domestic space that was especially exalted and protected from invaders in the Victorian era within England. This postcard may not reproduce such degrading characterizations, however, as it is clear that the male employer is the initiator in this illustration and it is unclear how the maidservant would respond if given more time to respond to his advances. Either way, it is apparent that the illustration sexualizes the maidservant and hints at her desirability as being threatening to the employer’s family, as hinted by the text from the daughter-in-law in the background. Her youthful beauty is problematized for not only the disunity it engenders, but also because the tray she is tasked with carrying and the food/beverages she perhaps prepared herself for those in her charge are tumbling to the floor. Domestics such as the one featured were often believed by British society to evade their responsibilities, an idea that is perpetuated within this illustration through the toppled tray. \n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard does not have a message or address, and it is not postmarked. As such, this postcard was not sent and perhaps was hand-delivered or kept by the purchaser for a personal collection.","analysis":"In this postcard, it is clear that the viewer is witnessing an act of sexual impropriety between the female domestic servant and her employer.

One of the helpers is playing a musical instrument while the other holds a heart-shaped umbrella over her head. She is dressed in a long, sleeveless orange and yellow dress, a long beaded necklace, and black hair tied into a bun with a headpiece. The front of the postcard has the caption “Valentine Greetings” with a poem underneath reading “Perfect? No, of course you’re not, But still I want to say, With all the little faults you’ve got I love you anyway!” The image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. This postcard is part of a series of Valentine’s Greetings. \nAnalysis: The postcard depicts two racialized men entertaining a white female mistress. Their skin is very dark which allows the viewer to hypothesize that they are of African descent, however, their elaborate Ottoman-style turbans, colorful harem pants, and traditional Indian shoes make the viewer assume they are of South Asian or West Asian descent. Their exact place of origin is deliberately left ambiguous. They are both racialized and exoticized at the same time. The purpose of these two racialized men seems to be Oriental ornamentation. Their brightly colored Orientalized attire, playful gesture, and black skin is used as a foil to highlight the lady’s immaculate whiteness, shyness, and femininity. The postcard follows the long tradition of European portraiture that depicted black and brown “boys” serving white mistresses, while leaving their provenance unclear. This racialization and exoticization supports the values of New Imperialism, where Western nations expanded their empires into Africa and Asia, and as a result, had access to labor from those people. These values are so relevant that even though it was a Valentine’s Day postcard with a Valentine’s Day poem, in the illustration love itself is commoditized and racialized in the spirit of New Imperialism.  \nMessage: Even though it is not postmarked and there is no message, it can be assumed that postcards, such as these, were perhaps exchanged between young, middle-class, white lovers as part of courtship. The racialized depiction of the black Orientalized “boys” would have perhaps been considered “cute” and flattering to the recipient, enabling the collector, sender, and recipient to collectively partake in imperialism through a simple everyday object like a Valentine’s Day card.","analysis":"The postcard depicts two racialized men entertaining a white female mistress.

The young white woman - wearing a flowy white dress - is sitting in front of the older Black woman - who is wearing a knotted white headdress, a black dress, and a white apron. The white woman rests with her elbow in her lap and her fist holding up her head; she is looking sorrowfully at the fireplace. The white woman’s left hand is reaching behind her, and is sitting in the lap of the older Black woman, who is comforting her. The Black woman is sitting tall, and is intent on being a comforting presence for the white woman. The background is a large, dark, bare room. With a large, beautiful fireplace and vertical columns lining the wall, the house seems to belong to a wealthy family. \n\nAnalysis: Although there is nothing humorous about the illustration on this postcard, there are aspects of racialization and class differentiation that serve to draw distinct differences between the two present women. The two women are dressed in distinct ways: the white woman is wearing a flowing white gown, while the Black woman is wearing a maid’s uniform. Their difference in attire marks their difference in socio-economic status; specifically, the Black woman’s uniform is an obvious representation of her role as a domestic worker. The Black woman’s knotted headdress, too, is symbolic of her heritage as an “exotic,” “otherized,” individual. It is also important to note that the Black woman is attentively serving in her act of comforting the white woman. The “Mammy” figure is often portrayed as being a perpetually maternal, emotionally attentive, and continuously attentive presence. This narrative is found in this illustration, in how the Black woman is focusing her attention on providing comfort - the Black woman’s upright posture, too, shows her attention.","analysis":"Although there is nothing humorous about the illustration on this postcard, there are aspects of racialization and class differentiation that serve to draw distinct differences between the two present women.

The setting seems to be outdoors, but is likely staged. The woman on the left is seated upon a bench that is placed in front of a wooden fence enclosing greenery behind it. The seated woman looks just away from the viewer and is wearing her hair tied back with a dark sari. Her arms and neck are adorned with jewelry and her left hand is holding onto the hand of the standing woman. The standing woman also looks away from the viewer with a similar placid expression. She wears a white sari, similar jewelry, and a striped blouse. Both women wear their sari over their hair in the traditional Indian fashion. \nAnalysis: This postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on two figures, homogenized under whatever text label is at the bottom, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization. In labeling these women “Hindu Ayahs” without a name, they are denied their identity and forced to embody a white construction of the Indian race. The intention behind this colonial imagery was to show a constructed illusion of natives as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of the empire to the British public back home. The ayahs’ passivity is emphasized in their inability to look directly at the viewer. There is also an intention to desexualize this figure: with increasing anxiety in Britain about white purity and miscegenation, the intimate relationship the ayah had within the home became a sore point for the empire. Thus, the ayah was depicted as intentionally plain, so as to negate any suspicions of impropriety and erase the long history of sexual exploitation within Indian domestic service.\nMessage: Blank.","analysis":"This postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on two figures, homogenized under whatever text label is at the bottom, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization.

Tunis.” This refers to the photographic studio responsible for the frontal image, run by Germans Rudolf Franz Lehnert and Ernest Heinrich Landrock, and also indicates that the photograph was taken in the capital of Tunisia. The verso of the postcard reads “Types d’Orient [Types of the Orient]” and “La servante du Harem [Servant of the Harem]” in French. One can presume that the woman pictured is a Tunisian native, or that the photographers want her to be interpreted as such. In her left hand, she holds a handled jug, her arm hanging down from her side and featuring a metal bangle at her wrist and an armband on her upper arm of a similar design. She is dressed in a flowing white robe, kept from revealing skin beyond her waist with a taut rope. Above her midsection, however, her left breast is left fully exposed for the viewer, the left part of her robe no longer covering her shoulder and upper chest on that side. She has hair that only reaches her shoulders and a bang that covers her forehead. One ear has a rhombus-shaped earring that extends slightly past her shoulder, while her left ear has a shorter yet wide hoop earring, presumably metal as well. The woman pictured appears to look back at the viewer, her expression casual, and the shoulder bearing the weight of the jug is lowered a bit. This gives her the impression of being relaxed as she perhaps leans against the wall shown behind her, with a vine covering her right arm from an observer.\n\nAnalysis: When this image is paired with the text on the verso, it becomes apparent that the photograph is meant to create an association between the woman pictured and earlier servants found inside “Oriental” harems, the separate spaces of older Muslim households designated for wives, concubines, and female domestics. At once, the space in which the viewer finds himself or herself is both anachronistic and intimate, as this domestic space was often conceptualized in European imagination as the inviolable domain of a woman in which only close relations and friends were permitted entry. Harems were also perceived as spaces of depravity, languor, and sexual promiscuity. As such, the sight of a non-white woman in such an imagined space likely offered European consumers respite from the rigid standards of sexual propriety that governed their own lives in their metripoles. The woman’s ornate earrings, jewelry on her arms and wrist, and her vaguely tropical background further transport a viewer to an “exotic” land and perhaps made it more acceptable for a European to ogle her body and claim ownership over her exposed frame because she was cast as a Harem servant inviting their lustful gaze rather than a white woman. The woman photographed is deprived of her personhood, merely labeled a Harem servant who exists for the imagined pleasure and service of a Muslim patriarch and now, the photographers seem to suggest, offers up her body in a similar way to the viewer. When colonized bodies were so frequently exploited for labor and their employment as domestics often flaunted the wealth and social status of European families, possessing a non-white woman’s body through postcard consumption enabled people who had never stepped foot within a colony to directly participate in and support the imperial enterprise of their homeland. Here, partially nude, the unnamed “Oriental” woman can be violated for the voyeuristic gratification of the viewer. These personal imperial victories were likely magnified because of the usual difficulty of seeing Tunisian women in such a way, given that the majority of them were Muslim and often kept much of their faces and bodies veiled under turbans and loose, flowing attire. Thus, contemporaries may have found the image especially intriguing for how it revealed what was otherwise forbidden, shrouded in mystery within a period when Europeans strove through ethnographic and anthropological studies to know all about their colonized peoples.\n\nMessage: This postcard contains no personal messages or addresses on its verso.

The words “Our Servants” feature in the left upper corner, and the name “Tom B.” also appears at the bottom left corner, indicating the artist of the illustration. In the drawing, a short, stout woman with a plumed hat faces a row of daintier, taller women. The short woman, featured on the left of the image, appears mid-aged and appraises the women abreast from her with a stern glare, her arms crossed indignantly across her chest. Her attire is noticeably less fashionable than that of the other women, wearing a jarring yellow shirt with red polka dots and a long blue skirt while some of the other females sport fur shawls and flowing, well-matched gowns and larger headpieces. The other women also appear much younger, and they seem  to offer deference to the older woman in folding their hands politely over their slightly-bent figures and chance demure glances up at her stubbornly erect frame.\n\nAnalysis: This image is meant to convey a role reversal between female employers of domestics in British households and the female servants they chose between. The text “Choosing A Mistress” hints, in the illustration, that the coarse-looking woman is actually a white domestic servant deciding which mistress she would like to essentially “hire” as her employer. This postcard would be humorous to a contemporary viewer because white, predominantly female domestic servants in Britain—often called “Bridgets” if Irish immigrants, as the orange-haired servant could very well be—were considered pompous and entitled, trying to negotiate working contracts and conditions, ask employers for time off on Catholic feast days or holidays, and were notorious quitting a domestic position if it was not to their liking. Since employers in this often undervalued profession were accustomed to setting the rules, they seldom took kindly to white domestic servants’ self-advocacy. Accordingly, the illustration’s servant occupies the role of domineering mistress herself, while the true mistresses in turn are cowed into submission and subject to the domestic’s critical eye. This postcard also offers commentary on the pervasive concern among middle-class women that their Irish immigrant domestic workers often purchased attire befitting an upper-class status with their salaries and would be thus mistaken for their mistresses, threatening their socioeconomic status by taking away their symbol of unique attire and by calling their identity as the authority-wielding employers into question. One’s clothing was also regarded as an indication of one’s moral hygiene as well, so if a domestic servant dressed better than her mistress, the narrative of Englishwomen’s moral superiority could also be challenged. In order to diffuse this worry, this postcard illustration derides the servant’s attempt to adopt the clothing of the mistresses, who still markedly outshine her mis-matched outfit despite likely hailing from a rural, impoverished place in Ireland like many of the so-called “Bridgets.” Finally, it was also due in part to the common race and gender of white female domestic servants compared to their employers that presented this problem of being equated with their mistresses, who relied upon them to bolster their status rather than to cast doubt over it.\n\nMessage: There is no address or message written on the verso, indicating that it was either handed personally to its intended recipient or was never given to a recipient.","analysis":"This image is meant to convey a role reversal between female employers of domestics in British households and the female servants they chose between.

The Boarding-House Slavey.” A boarding house is a house in which lodgers rent one or more rooms per night, occasionally for extended periods of weeks, months, and years. The illustration features a female domestic servant, whose status is indicated by the humble red shirt, rolled-up sleeve cuffs, white apron, and matching bonnet atop her head. Her appearance is disheveled and dirty, which dark stains on her body and apron, even on her nose. Her expression appears gleeful nonetheless, as she holds a dark bar that she has been using to scrub shoes with that have presumably been left by the lodgers in the boarding house. One of the darkened shoes is on her hand closest to the viewer, and the others lie scattered around her in disarray. On the back wall of the room that she occupies, what appears to be two plate lids are stuck with presumably food stains trailing down the wall. \n\nAnalysis: \nThis postcard conveys the failed attempts of a white domestic servant, likely an Irish immigrant given the stereotypical color of her hair, to shine or clean the shoes left in her care within a boarding house. The primary suggestion made by her quite obvious, likely comical blunder is that Irish domestic laborers are ignorant, naive, and bring more dirt and trouble to an employer’s house than they do order and cleanliness. It was believed by some that female Irish domestics—often called the derogatory and homogenizing term “Bridgets”—were unintelligent, especially since many of them hailed from humble backgrounds in rural Ireland without formal training in domestic work. Overall, these were commonly-held notions about such Irish domestics and heavily contributed to the perceived shortage of competent domestic workers in Britain at the time known as the “servant problem.” In addition, the text on the postcard’s front employs the word “slavey” to describe the Irish maidservant, as though linking her status to that of an enslaved, racialized “Other.” Although this is not necessarily the case in this postcard, many visual sources produced around its time imbued Irish “Bridgets” with with simian-like features, a strategy used to dehumanize and accentuate the perceived racial differences of people of African descent considered racially inferior. The dark smudges all over the “Bridget” might also signify her position of “blackness” compared to her presumed employer, and perhaps the stain of her iniquity in being an idiotic worker who fails to complete her responsibilities as desired due to the negative connotations related to dark colors in Britain at the time. The fact that she is darkening all of the footwear that has been left in her possession further establishes the Bridget’s association with blackness and the idea of such a race tainting what it comes into contact with. Non-white peoples were often seen themselves as dirty, a notion that would feature in soap advertisements around this time as well, insisting that supposedly lower, degenerated races needed to be “cleansed” to appear hygienic and civilized. More plainly, the dark smudges on her body and clothing—which closely resembles dirt—could also indicate her lowly status as a domestic worker and her frequent encounter with dirt, a physical marker of labor that British middle and upper class families tried so fervently to erase from their persons and homes so as to emphasize their higher socioeconomic status. Finally, the illustration could hint that the Bridget is neglecting more serious duties and just playing around, invoking the stereotype of the lazy Bridget who was better off not being hired.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard contains no personal message or address.

The woman on the far right is seated lowest to the ground out of the three women and wears a white shawl over white native dress. She looks off camera with her face in a still, but somber expression. The expression is mimicked by the other two women in the photograph. The ayah on the far left also sits in a squatted position that is typical of servants. She wears a white shawl draped over her head and underneath wears a white striped skirt with bangles on her arms. The final woman stands above the other two ayahs with her right hand placed on the left ayah. Her white shawl, draped over her head and around her body, hangs over her floral skirt. Her expression is also placid, but looks downward. The expressions and manner of sitting echo the norms for domestic servants in India.\nAnalysis: Type postcards such as this one served the purpose of presenting native peoples through the lens of white, romantic constructions of race. In the name of ethnographic study, staging these ayahs in obviously subservient positions associates Indians with domestic service in the public’s mind. This is heightened by the fact that the ayahs are not mentioned by name: in referring to these women with their occupational status, ayah, they are removed from individuality and minimized to the work they perform for British colonial employers. Of special importance is the respectability of these ayahs: even their hair is covered and are wholly desexualized in this image. As the British presence in India grew, so did British moral anxieties about the increased interracial, interclass, and interreligious exposure between native races and the British. The ayah then became a visual signifier for a moral empire; the desexualized ayah, usually past her sexual prime as these women are, suggested Christian values of morality and chastity, but most importantly, erased the history of sexual violence that accompanied domestic service roles in the colonial context. \nMessage: “Ethnic India—nursemaid ayahs.”","analysis":"Type postcards such as this one served the purpose of presenting native peoples through the lens of white, romantic constructions of race.

Tom, an enslaved domestic worker, is sitting on a wooden bench. He is wearing a bright white, collared shirt with a navy blazer. He has on white dress pants and black boots. Eva, a white child who Tom takes care of, is sitting on his lap in a peach colored dress and tights with white shoes on. She has red hair and Tom has gray hair. Tom is reading a book that is in his right hand and his left hand is over Eva’s shoulder. The postcard depicts a scene of “Uncle Tom and Eva” and with the following text: “‘Uncle Tom,’ said Eva, ‘I’m going there.’ ‘Where, Miss Eva?’ The glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the sky. ‘I am going there,’ she said, ‘to the spirits bright, Tom; I’m going before long.’”\nThe image is vertical, making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp.\nAnalysis: This postcard shows the stereotype of ‘Tom’ who is a faithful, submissive, and happy enslaved man.

The white woman is sitting at a small tea table, reading a small card; to her side the Black woman is standing. The white woman is wearing a silk blouse with lace, and the Black woman is wearing a checkered maid’s dress with an apron and a white bow in her hair. The white woman is attentively reading the card. The Black woman is looking at the face of the white woman, smiling contentedly. In the background, on the wall, is a large tapestry; on the tea table is a small flower vase. The caption of the postcard reads, ‘Merry words, merry words, ye come bursting around / Telling all that affection can say / “Tis the music of heart-chords that dwells in the sound / ‘Many happy returns of the day.’” It is unclear whether these words are coming from the card that the white woman is reading, or either of the women themselves. \n\nAnalysis: This postcard, although a photograph, is not true to life; the scene and the subjects of the photograph are staged in a way that suggests an intimate employer-employee relationship between the two women. The Black woman’s attire is meant to be indicative of her labor as a domestic servant, and lies in stark contrast with the attire of the white woman - whose fancy dress is meant to denote her as being from a higher class. The Black woman patiently and contentedly waiting on the white woman is meant to perpetuate the narrative of benevolent patriarchalism; the Black woman is supposed to enjoy her role as a domestic laborer, implying that the employer is a benevolent, civilizing, caring presence in her life.

Her modest attire and submissive gaze denote her as being of a lesser socio-economic and racial status.

The young girl is dressed in very stereotypical British attire for her age, in a white skirt with blue ribbons and matching hat. Behind her, she seems to be pulling some kind of toy. Her hand is being held by this ayah figure. The ayah is wearing a blend of British and native attire: while her white sari is native, the addition of a red coat and even the umbrella are British additions. She is also wearing shoes, typical of British influence. She wears ornate jewelry, such as a nose stud, earrings, and a necklace. The scene is civil and likely meant to showcase a typical, proper relationship between caretaker and child. The text below is faint, but reads “An Ayah” on the left and potentially “Gilette & Harington” on the right. \nAnalysis: This interaction between an ayah and her young British ward is a sterile portrayal of Anglo-Indian relationships, which is key to consider in the context of Britain. Within the British empire, ayahs functioned as nursemaids for white families, but they were also the closest point of contact for Anglo-Indian intimate relationships. This made them highly visible characters when debating interracial connections within empire. The ayah was presented as a status symbol for British families that allowed them to display their wealth, show off their morality in employing natives, and give them the luxury of free time. It was also a point of pride that the ayah was a contractual servant, further proving the morality of the empire. The fears of miscegenation were also projected onto ayah’s bodies as it became uniquely important to hide any illicitness that may have existed in these associations. Intended for a British audience, this postcard serves to dispel anxieties about impropriety but this is not to say that such sexual harrassment did not occur: domestic and sexual labor often went hand in hand in these close, oppressive relationships. In presenting this desexualized figure, the postcard aids in the effort of erasing a history of sexual exploitation. \nMessage: (in verso) “An Ayah: The term ayah may be applied both to nurses for children and ladies’ maids. The best ayahs hail generally from the Madras Presidency, and are more in request than the natives of other parts of India, being more up-to-date and amenable to European customs. They frequently become attached to the European children in their charge, the inevitable parting causing them great distress.” The characterization of ayahs as loyal to their British families and incredibly attached to their wards is a common colonial trope intended to showcase the benevolence of the British and the intimate relationship between ayah and child, thereby negating accusations of mistreatment both in the home and the Indian colony itself.","analysis":"This interaction between an ayah and her young British ward is a sterile portrayal of Anglo-Indian relationships, which is key to consider in the context of Britain.

The ayah wears a yellow sari. The sari is draped over her shoulders and over her head in a show of modesty. She wears a brown jacket vest underneath. Her skin is fully covered, with her feet in shoes. She looks directly at the viewer. She stands behind with her hands on a baby’s carriage. The ornate carriage carries a white baby who, like the ayah, stares at the viewer. The baby is dressed very posh with yellow lace and pink bows all over her dress. The pair stand in front of a house, presumably in India, with vines on the fence.\nAnalysis: The process of hand-tinting a photograph gives the artist a level of control over the presentation of a given image: therefore, the purposeful colorizing of this image serves to exoticize the ayah by putting her in bright colors, while also intentionally darkening her skin. This postcard presents an ordinary scene as a snippet into the daily life of an ayah and her white ward, as though the viewer had stumbled on the scene naturally occurring. These glimpses into the everyday life of ethnic servants served convey Western influence in the colonies, especially the nature of interracial relations. The relationship between ayah and her white ward is one of the most intimate of interracial living, and postcards such as this one would have allowed for those back home to witness a glimpse of how comfortable each party was with one another. In presenting this as the norm, the postcard also accomplishes a solidification of the hierarchy of races: this postcard helps to normalize natives as domestic servants for white people. Ayahs, who were homogenized in that they were never given names in postcards, were the natural caretakers of white children—they are thus denied an identity outside of their service. Her attire and almost matronly appearance desexualizes the figure of the ayah in an effort to erase any implications of sexual promiscuity within the British home. These glimpses into empire allowed British citizens in the UK and across the empire to have access to and participate in colonial efforts in India despite their distance. \nMessage: The verso of the postcard says, “Lizzie,” but it is unclear as to when this might have been written. Considering the postcard was never mailed, this would not have been addressing an individual.","analysis":"The process of hand-tinting a photograph gives the artist a level of control over the presentation of a given image: therefore, the purposeful colorizing of this image serves to exoticize the ayah by putting her in bright colors, while also intentionally darkening her skin.

The ayah looks off into the distance, and wears all white attire. Her blouse is high necked with short sleeves, and her sari is white with a red border, similar to the saris that ayahs are often painted in. The bottom of the sari falls right above her ankles, exposing her shoeless feet. Her white ward wears a similarly practical outfit: a blue, flouncy, collared set with white shoes and socks. The white child, unlike ayah, looks directly at the viewer. The setting appears to be some sort of town setting, where the architecture seems to be of British origin. \nAnalysis: This postcard follows a “type” style, in that it is an illustration of a South Asian woman in a staged setting. Native women in “type” postcards are commonly presented as a fantasy, and represent a particular white, romanticized construction of race—in this case, the “type” is the ayah who is defined only through her relationship with her white ward. Even the use of “ayah” in the text, rather than the subject’s name, serves to depersonalize and homogenize the ayah as little more than the loyal caretaker. She is not herself,  but rather a representation of all ayahs. In the absence of the ability to employ these sought-after caretakers, the postcard is a means of having access to this kind of woman. Even the gazes of the two figures feels intentional: while the ayah stares elsewhere, away from the viewer, it is the white child who has the knowledge to locate the eyes of the viewer.

The woman is wearing a red dress with white vertical stripes, a white apron, and a knotted red headdress with white dots. The woman’s sleeves are rolled up, and she carries a cane in her right hand. The woman’s skin is nearly sheer black, in direct contrast with her white apron and the blank white background; her skin is so darkly monochrome that her only discernible facial feature is her large mouth. The woman is standing with a straight, almost regal posture. The only other thing accompanying the woman is the title: “It is better to smoke here than hereafter.” \n\nAnalysis: The caricatured woman on the front of the postcard is meant to be a Black Mammy. This is clear from her age (which is telegraphed in the fact that she uses a cane), her clothing (tattered, modest), her labor (indicative in her apron and rolled-up sleeves), and her stature (tall and wide): all physical features attributed to the Mammy. The woman is desexualized with her wide frame and traditionally-masculine physique, which is common in the portrayal of a nurturing, maternal Mammy caricature. A large mouth and lips are common in contemporary depictions of racialized Black peoples, and is present in this postcard. Her headdress is a reminder of her supposedly exotic heritage; the headdress is the only small remaining remnant of her exotic dress and presentation, all others (as the civilizing narrative goes) have been “remedied” by her “benevolent” employer. The title, “It is better to smoke here than hereafter,” is the humorous aspect of this card. This saying, however, is meant to convey the hard-earned wisdom common to characterizations of the Mammy figure; interestingly, the message itself may also suggest that the Mammy’s wisdom is guided by hedonistic notions of relaxation and self-care - suggesting that there is a certain foolishness to the Black Mammy’s wisdom. Finally, the fact that she is smoking at all is likely meant to distance her from traditional notions of upper-class femininity, as smoking is often seen as a man’s pastime.\n\nMessage: The message is found on the front of the postcard, scrawled around and on top of the Mammy figure; the verso of the card simply denotes the intended recipient of the card and their address. The message on the front is not very legible, and the few recognizable phrases (“I am going to send you your…, “Sure wish I was with you today,” and “Come up to see me.”) are not all that relevant to the postcard’s contents.

The children, one boy and one girl, are both slumped over in their chairs, sleeping after a Thanksgiving meal. In the top left corner is a colorful picture of a turkey within a circle. The caption of the postcard reads: “Thanksgiving Greetings.” The children are dressed in fancy attire for their Thanksgiving dinner. The girl is wearing a bright pink dress with a similarly colored bow in her hair; the boy is wearing a navy blue suit. The Black woman, on the other hand, is wearing modest work attire: a modest blue blouse, a kerchief, a white apron, and a knotted red headdress with yellow dots. The Black woman at the center of the image is standing with her palms open and a large smile, happy to see that the children she has served are satisfied with their dinner. \n\nAnalysis: This Thanksgiving postcard sentimentalizes the presence and the care of the stereotypical Mammy figure. The Mammy is serving the children with a smile, and the children are satisfied; this imagery serves to justify the narrative of benevolent patriarchalism that suggests that the Mammy figure has the most to gain from this employer-employee relationship. The Mammy’s attire is evocative of her labor and her race. Her apron and kerchief mark her clearly as a domestic servant, and her bright headdress marks her as having a heritage as an “otherized,” “exotic” individual. What is important to note is that the Mammy figure in this postcard is not Black; indeed, she is a white woman in blackface. This is a great example of how photographic images do not accurately represent reality. Aside from the color of her skin, the assertion that a Black domestic servant would be content in serving her wealthy white employers is fictitious; the narrative of a contented Mammy serves to deepen narratives of benevolent patriarchalism. \n\nMessage: This postcard was sent from Boston, Massachusetts to West Somerville, Massachusetts. The sender of this postcard is a father, who is gifting this postcard to his son for his postcard collection. The message reads: “Here is another card for your album, my dear boy.

The Mammy is serving the children with a smile, and the children are satisfied; this imagery serves to justify the narrative of benevolent patriarchalism that suggests that the Mammy figure has the most to gain from this employer-employee relationship. The Mammy’s attire is evocative of her labor and her race. Her apron and kerchief mark her clearly as a domestic servant, and her bright headdress marks her as having a heritage as an “otherized,” “exotic” individual. What is important to note is that the Mammy figure in this postcard is not Black; indeed, she is a white woman in blackface. This is a great example of how photographic images do not accurately represent reality. Aside from the color of her skin, the assertion that a Black domestic servant would be content in serving her wealthy white employers is fictitious; the narrative of a contented Mammy serves to deepen narratives of benevolent patriarchalism. \n\nMessage: This postcard was sent from Boston, Massachusetts to West Somerville, Massachusetts.

Their status can be implied from the standard red and white or green uniforms of the men along with the white bonnets and matching aprons of the women present. It is clear from the text accompanying the visual that they are in a dining room of their employer’s house, mindful of the fact that their employers are upstairs and will not likely not discover their gathering. At the top of the postcard, “Our Servants’ Problem” is written, along with “The Dinner. ‘For what we have received &c.” The bottom contains the following, which appears to be uttered by one of the domestic servants assembled: “‘They won’t disturb us upstairs for some time, ‘cos they’re gone into the drawing room and Signor something is playing a long fantasmigoria [sic] on a big fiddle.’”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard decisively portrays the servants gathered around the dining table in a negative light, joking about--but nevertheless criticizing--their supposed laziness due to their purposeful evasion of their household work. In depicting white working-class maidservants and menservants as indolent, this ephemera aligns itself with a broader societal stereotype of its day that decried a supposed shortage of competent, industrious servants and attributed this dearth in part to the laziness of those currently employed. This so-called “servant’s problem” is something that the text also makes a comedic reference to at the top of the illustration, as it could even hint that the “servant’s problem” is actually the domestics’ predicament of running the risk of having their unsanctioned dinner-during-work-time interrupted by their employers. Such domestic servants were often ridiculed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries for being too entitled, whether negotiating their employment contrasts or asking for time off, and this postcard also utilizes this stereotype in the other portion of text accompanying the illustration which hints that the domestics feel that their service has made them eligible for the privilege of spontaneous dinners and lounging around during their work hours. The postcard also implies that such laborers are deceptive--another common notion disseminated at this time--as the text at the bottom of the postcard reveals their careful estimation as to how they can continue their dinner unnoticed by their employers upstairs. Lastly, this postcard may also hint that the domestics shown plundered food from their own employers in order to host a dinner amongst themselves, an unflattering depiction that was frequently employed to problematize white working-class servants who supposedly had inferior moral sensibilities to those of their higher-class employers.\n\nMessage: The message on the verso is hard to read, but it appears to insist to the intended recipient that someone loves her very much even if she does not know or believe it. The address indicates that the postcard is meant for a certain “Miss M. Campbell” who lives in Ardrishaig, a coastal village in Scotland.","analysis":"This postcard decisively portrays the servants gathered around the dining table in a negative light, joking about--but nevertheless criticizing--their supposed laziness due to their purposeful evasion of their household work.

Your master, you will care for, with love and devotion. Coq en pâte, you will return it, by care, completely. His kisses, you will accept, without any protest. Day and night, will bear his desires very patiently. By doing this you will risk being laid on by his will!” After the poem finishes, there is a smiley face that possesses a devious grin. The accompanying illustration shows a short, stout man with a devilish smile standing behind a white domestic servant who holds a straw basket over her waist. The man has encircled his arms around the upper chest of the female domestic, who faces the viewer with a buck-toothed smile. Her apron and her white bonnet, especially when seen alongside the aforementioned text, confirm her status as a domestic servant. Her cheeks are rosy and her hair is worn in a blonde bob. \nAnalysis: The postcard depicts the sexual temptations posed by youthful white domestic servants, and hints crudely that the job of an ideal servant is to willingly accept and endure the advances of a male employer. While this card was clearly intended to be humorous to its contemporary audience, its content alludes to the more heinous reality of sexual predation that domestic servants often faced. Instead of problematizing that potentially exploitative sexual and nonconsensual relationship, the text suggests that the domestic servant encourages the courtship of the male employer by giving into his every whim, revealing an obsequiousness that was demanded of all domestic servants and which was compounded by this domestic’s identity as a the “inferior” gender. So, while the sexual undertones manifest in the text—such as in the last line about “being laid on”—and in the more explicit illustration are humorous, they can also reveal much about the often demeaning and boundary-violating expectations of female domestic servants in which they were often accused of being complicit. These employer-domestic relationships could also violate the supposed sexual and moral propriety of the former’s home, undermine the power of Parisian mistresses, and would have been especially intolerable if the domestic was visibly non-white due to fears of miscegenation and racial degeneration. \n\nMessage: This postcard was likely not mailed, given the absence of a stamp. The verso contains a personal message, but it is unintelligible. From the words that can be deciphered, it appears as though the message makes sexual references that are perhaps inspired by the postcard’s illustration and frontal text.","analysis":"The postcard depicts the sexual temptations posed by youthful white domestic servants, and hints crudely that the job of an ideal servant is to willingly accept and endure the advances of a male employer.

The mistress is identified by her elaborate red dress that goes down to the floor and her lack of the apron, bonnet, stockings and blue uniform underneath that accompanies the domestic servant respectively. The bottom portion of text reads as follows: “Mistress: ‘Cook, I did not know you were here.’ Cook: ‘It first matter, mem, but another time please to knock at the door I thought you was out.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard represents an imagined exchange between a black female domestic servant and her mistress, with the accompanying dialogue taking off after the former has been discovered shirking her duties and playing the piano. In a reversal of roles, it appears that the female domestic servant, particularly a cook, is bossing around her mistress and asking her to knock the next time that she interrupts her playing. This reversal is humorous in not only its improbability, but also for its relation to stereotypes facing non-white domestics around this time in Britain. Although the cook’s lower status in relation to her mistress is clearly indicated by her clothing, it would have been obvious to a contemporary audience that she was not the one entitled to luxury when expected to work, hinting at non-white domestic laborers’ alleged sloth and negligence toward their assigned household chores. Her speech betrays a supposed ignorance, as she speaks in “improper” English and with a lack of formality unbecoming to a domestic servant addressing one’s employer. There was also a stereotype that non-white domestics were trying to negotiate the terms of their labor too much and the conditions they received in their employer’s home as well, beginning to lord over the house with entitled demeanors unsuited for their socioeconomic status. Some of this stereotype is also invoked through the black domestic’s dismissive words toward her mistress. \n\nMessage: “Sr. Ben, Thanks very much for card and good wishes.

The woman on the left is seated upon a bench that is placed in front of a wooden fence enclosing greenery behind it. The seated woman looks just away from the viewer and is wearing her hair tied back and a red and green sari. Her arms and neck are adorned with jewelry and her left hand is holding onto the hand of the standing woman. The standing woman also looks away from the viewer with a similar placid expression. She wears a white sari, similar jewelry, and a red striped blouse. Both women wear their sari over their hair in the traditional Indian fashion. Their lips have also been colored in to give the appearance of a red lip. \nAnalysis: This postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on two figures, homogenized under whatever text label is at the bottom, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization. In labeling these women “Hindu Women” without a name, they are denied their identity and forced to embody a white construction of the Indian race. The intention behind this colonial imagery was to show a constructed illusion of natives as exoticized, but ultimately passive recipients of the empire to the British public back home. The women’s passivity is emphasized in their inability to look directly at the viewer. There is also an intention to desexualize this figure: with increasing anxiety in Britain about white purity and miscegenation, the intimate relationship the ayah had within the home became a sore point for the empire. In this case, the term ayah has been removed totally to represent these women as simply native women, either with no ill will or the goal of further homogenizing these women. \nMessage: Blank.","analysis":"This postcard has all the features of a “type” postcard: the focus is on two figures, homogenized under whatever text label is at the bottom, who serves to represent all of the ethnic group through their depersonalization.

He is also wearing a maroon/brown turban and red/orange laced-up shoes. He has a long mustache and beard grown to his mid-torso. He is standing with a bag slung over his shoulder and tools in his right hand. He is looking straight forward, directly at the photographer. The surrounding area shows something covered by a curtain, as can be seen by the ruffles at the floor. The postcard contains the caption “BARBER.” The image is vertical making the postcard portrait orientation. The verso is split, not postmarked, and has no stamp. This postcard was “Printed in Germany” and is part of a series of postcards by Moorli Dhur & Sons depicting Indian servants in British imperial households.\nAnalysis: This is an ethnographic “type” postcard. The subject depicted is an Indian barber. We do not know if the man photographed actually worked as a domestic servant in a British imperial household. Anthropological postcards such as this were usually posed and performed. \nThe image on the postcard would have been a black and white photograph that was later hand painted into color, known as a hand-tinted photograph. As a hand-tinted work, the artist had discretion over the colors used, and his neat, blemish-free clothes may have been how he dressed, however, it is arguable that his dress, particularly its coloring, was emphasized as a way to exoticisize him; how could he be laboring all day and be dressed so neatly and brightly? \nThe postcard serves as an ethnographic visual of what an Indian man-servant looks like, and by extension, what all Indian men look like. Additionally, it asserts Indian men’s role in society as servants within the British imperial household. In a British household in colonized India, the family may have upwards of twenty servants, with all but one or two being men. Therefore, this postcard not only portrays the Indian man as a worker in the British household, but also shows the British audience ‘at home’ that the sender of this postcard has wealth that allows for the hiring of multiple servants. Britain middle-class households, by contrast, could mostly afford one or two maidservants. The 1777 Servant Tax in Britain imposed on employers for men-servants made men-servants expensive status symbols. At the same time, there was a long history of black and brown “boys” in servile roles used in European family portraits as status symbols. Thus, this postcard of an Indian manservant would highlight the British imperial household’s affluence and imperial grandeur. \nBy picturing him in traditional Indian attire with a turban and a long beard, he is the opposite of traditional British dress. This opposition exocitisizes the pictured man and perpetuates the British colonizing mission by claiming that ‘Indians need the British to civilize them.’\nThis postcard is part of a set of postcards illustrating different types of men-servants in British imperial India. It is labeled “1350” on the verso.\nMessage: The only word on the backside of the postcard is “Mother.” Without a postmark or a stamp, it can be assumed that the word is not a message meant to be sent, but maybe the name of an owner or reseller.","analysis":"This is an ethnographic “type” postcard.

It is labeled “1350” on the verso.\nMessage: The only word on the backside of the postcard is “Mother.” Without a postmark or a stamp, it can be assumed that the word is not a message meant to be sent, but maybe the name of an owner or reseller.","message":"The only word on the backside of the postcard is “Mother.” Without a postmark or a stamp, it can be assumed that the word is not a message meant to be sent, but maybe the name of an owner or reseller.","__v":0,"imageLinks":[{"_id":"67081b3c67fa9da418a00400","name":"205B","link":"/images/postcards/205B.jpg","size":{"width":1122,"height":1736},"orientation":1,"cardNumber":205},{"_id":"67081b3c67fa9da418a00401","name":"205A","link":"/images/postcards/205A.jpg","size":{"width":1109,"height":1726},"orientation":1,"cardNumber":205}],"originalLocation":{"latitude":51.1638175,"longitude":10.4478313,"_id":"67ccb20c6c89aaaae23d41b7"},"isBlurByDefault":false,"isInScrapbook":false,"themes":["Anthropological/ethnographic","South Asia","Orientalism","Photographic","Moorli Dhur & Sons","Hand Tinted","British Empire","Men-servants","New Imperialism"]},{"_id":"670580871d3345f198753cef","number":157,"item":"postcard","date":"Post-1907","postmarked":"No","place":null,"company":"n/a","companyInformation":"n/a","description":"In this postcard, a reclining (nearly) nude light-skinned woman is accompanied by a dark-skinned attendant who sits on the floor playing a string instrument.

Muslim people and spaces then became subjects of voyeuristic interest for the colonizers and mainland French people. This postcard offers a voyeruistic glimpse into the harem, and orientalized space within a Muslim household accessible only to women, which a European male viewer portrayed as both exclusive and arousing. This illustration serves as an example of the homogenous erotic image of the harem, rather than a factual depiction of that space. This postcard also upholds the harmful colonial iconographic tradition of positioning dark-skinned bodies in perpetual service of a white body. \n\nMessage: This postcard contains no personal messages or addresses on its verso.

John Valentine founded his printing and photography business in 1851, and his son expanded it. By the end of the 19th century, Valentine & Sons had expanded from Scotland to Great Britain, New Zealand, Jamaica, Morocco, in order to market images of popular tourist destinations from those regions. Valentine & Sons entered the picture postcard market in 1898 and continued to grow the business until the 1970 when they halted the production of postcards altogether. This postcard is signed by Lawson Wood, who worked as a painter and illustrator (of postcards and other media) from 1896 until the late 1940s.","description":"In this illustration, the same young girl from the second postcard in this series stands outdoors in the company of six working-class men, as they can be identified by their dress. The girl stands with her hands behind her back and her eyebrows raised as she looks at the men who stand in a doorway, sit on a brick wall, and lean upon a tin can, all meeting her open gaze. At the bottom of the illustration, a block of text reads “The Servant and How to Train Her- ‘She will probably take some interest in the Tradespeople: this is only natural and should be encouraged.’” \n\nAnalysis: This series was meant to prepare an employer with a set of frustrating mistakes to be made by their newly hired domestic servants, as well as how to contend with these issues. The sequenced cartoons are explained via the text at the bottom of the composition, as if directly addressing a hiring mistress with words of advice. The illustrations depict caricatures of young domestic workers in a way that the contemporary viewer would have found humorous. The postcard shown here is part of a complete six-piece series. The third illustration of the series shows an assortment of working-class characters standing in an enclosed courtyard outside the house where a brick wall and doorway separate domestic from public space. The text’s reference to the men as “Tradespeople” means to associate them, and the female servant, with the lower-class. An employer would have wanted a domestic servant to socialize within her own socio-economic class, because that would preserve the inherent hierarchy within the servant-employer relationship. In order to maintain the lower value of servants’ labor compared to that of their employers, any opportunity for class mobility for those in the lower classes had to be extinguished. \n \nThis postcard was mailed to a Miss Linda Moore at 25 Glenfell Road in Epson, New Zealand. This is one of the few postcards in this collection which is addressed to a specific house number within a particular address, which is due to its much later date of circulation (in 1969). The message reads, “She was only the chemists (sic) daughter/ But she wouldn’t let the pharmacie”. While it is unclear if this message has any relationship to the recto illustration, it is meant to be a humorous pun which aligns with the intended humorous nature of the postcard. The message takes part in a format of jokes which start off with “She was only the [insert profession]’s daughter, but…” followed by a crude innuendo insinuating the daughter’s promiscuity. The innuendo always forms a pun that is related to the named profession.","analysis":"This series was meant to prepare an employer with a set of frustrating mistakes to be made by their newly hired domestic servants, as well as how to contend with these issues.

The words “Servant’s Insurance Act” can be seen at the top right of the postcard as well, underscored as though suggesting its significance to the illustration. Her status as a maid is indicated by her black dress with white trim and a white half-apron, with a ruffled headpiece atop her curly orange hair. She elevates one of her feet, which is crudely bandaged. On the small bedside table that features in the postcard, there are three items atop a tray with the following labels, from left to right: “Bovril,” “Cream,” and “Wine.” At the bottom of the postcard, the text seems to clarify the maid’s situation, and reads: “I burnt my small toe and I don’t mean to work till it is quite better, I prefer to have a burnt toe.”\n\nAnalysis: This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act. Following the example set by Germany, the referenced National Insurance Act was implemented in the U.K. as of 1911. This measure provided the first contributory system of insurance against sickness and unemployment for the working classes earning salaries in the U.K.. Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid for a certain amount of weeks, sometimes eligible for free medical treatments for illnesses like tuberculosis. Given the items on the bedside table and the domestic’s satisfied expression in the postcard, the illustrator seems to suggest that “Bridgets” were taking advantage of these novel legal protections to shirk their responsibilities. Depictions of Irish domestics at the time frequently featured lazy characters, even some who intentionally injured themselves to reap the benefits of the act’s provisions. In the particular case illustrated, the domestic servant plans to read in bed despite only having burned a pinkie toe. The items on the bedside table, particularly the wine, also invoke an offensive stereotype which assumed that “Bridgets” were more susceptible to drinking as predominantly Irish Catholics. Beliefs like these, even if made somewhat humorous in the postcard present, raised alarm that British households increasingly relied upon Irish immigrants to provide domestic service and could perhaps introduce immoral practices to the families in their charge. The “Bovril” on the table was a thick and salty meat extract paste that some contemporaries believed could function as makeshift medicine, but it could also be used as a “beef tea” of sorts and could explain why cream is present on the table as well. One potentially humorous reading of these items is that the “Bridget” has plundered these items from her employers under the pretense of needing them to recover from her injury, as a popular stereotype about “Bridgets” at the time was that they often stole their employers’ food as their own and would even invite unwelcome guests into the house they served to indulge in the supplies.\n\nMessage: The verso of this postcard simply contains the written message “Souvenir of Casablanca,” translated from French. The address side of the verso reads as follows, when translated into English: “Mr. Jules Boulland at Laissy, Seine-et-Oise, France.”","analysis":"This postcard conveys a lounging female domestic servant--presumably an Irish immigrant, stereotyped as a “Bridget” in Britain--who expresses her preference to take as much time away from work as possible given her burned toe since she is insured under the Servant’s Insurance Act.

Dress shoes hang from the hooks, a vest hangs inside out on the left corner, a suit jacket is draped sloppily on the right corner, an umbrella is shoved in the decorative center of the coat rack, and a top hat lays on the floor. A frame also appears to be crookedly hanging on the wall above the woman, as if it is about to fall. The domestic servant holds a hand broom and dustpan as she looks upon the scene, and her jaw hangs open. The caption at the bottom of the composition reads, “It’s quite evident Master didn’t go to a temperance meeting last night.” \n\nAnalysis: The image on this postcard insinuates that the “Master”, mentioned by the caption, left evidence of a sexual encounter. This would have been equally shocking and humorous to the contemporary viewer, as the scene is juxtaposed with mention of a temperance meeting. The Temperance Movement, which advocated for abstinence from alcohol consumption, was active in England throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Temperance became associated with proper Christian morality, as many religious groups adopted the cause within their denominations. This image, then, is most likely meant to allude to the Master’s sexual promiscuity which would have conflicted with his outward affiliation with conservative Christian values. Having stumbled upon this realization, the domestic servant’s position of being intimately familiar with her hiring family’s personal lives (despite being an outsider) is emphasized. \n\nThis postcard was mailed to a Mr W. E. Green at 21 Heath Street in Seeds Road Bradford. Bradford most likely refers to the city of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England.","analysis":"The image on this postcard insinuates that the “Master”, mentioned by the caption, left evidence of a sexual encounter.
